But it is frequently compared to Subnautica and costs almost 2/3 of that. It is NOT 2/3 as good. And at a ""overwhelmingly positive"" status it can stomach the odd ""negative"" rating pointing this out. Whenever I do this (reviewing a game based on what it currently offers) I always get comments about seeing it for it's potential. And that potential is certainly there. If you buy games for their potential you'll be happy with Planet Crafter. Update April 2023: After a year the dev has added a bunch more content but I've not had the patience to play that far because he has addressed zero of the QoL criticisms. /Update What it does well: [*]A varied environment to explore [*]Terraforming actively changes the environment, opening possible paths [*]Encountered no serious bugs from what I can recall [*]Meteor showers offer something of a risk reward tradeoff. Getting hit hurts but if you want their resources you need to be out when they happen. These resources also ensure that it's pretty much impossible to get deadlocked by missing resources (as those laying around on the planet are finite) [*]When you die you simply drop some of your inventory and can go pick it up again [*]Can explore crashed ships etc [*]Environments are nice and varied but transitions can be a bit too jarring. Near the aluminium spikes for example it's always dark for no logical reason. What it should do better: [*]Progression system needs massive work. Many of the personal upgrades are completely useless. I have not felt ANY improvement from the walk or mining speed upgrades. None. Meanwhile I'd argue the o2 tank upgrades are actually too powerful. You are quickly able to traverse almost the entire map with only a single spare canister. Similarly upgrading your terraforming machines is more busiwork than satisfying progression. In this area the game feels more like an idle clicker that simply makes you do stuff so number go up slightly faster. Even the rockets fall into this trap. The first provides a massive boost and then returns quickly diminish. Some of the more advanced machines are actually worse proportionally than the earlier ones. [*]The SPAMMY base building. You need massive farms of power plants and terraforming machines to progress, which quickly devalues the experience of building any of them [*]building system in general. Every base is magically hovering in the air and many of the outdoor elements don't snap to each other. [*]You go from being essentially tied to your life pod to casually crossing the entire map in no time. Also you can just plonk down a cheap hab block in each biome and you're never going to die again. [*]Upgrading your exoskeleton usually results in you dropping everything because of how the upgrades chain on each other. How it could do better: [*]Have fewer upgrades, further apart and make them more meaningful in return. You don't need 5 walk speed upgrades of 10% each. Make ONE that doubles your speed. In general upgrades that let you do something new are more fun than upgrades that just let you do something better. [*]Drop most of the O2 upgrades and introduce a rover instead (seamoth analog). This would still allow you to explore further out but without spamming mini bases all around or losing any kind of urgency because your o2 tank lasts for days. [*]Flesh out the genetic manipulation aspect. Instead of simply upgrading obsolete flower to less obsolete trees. What if you could sequence the flower genomes and test what each allele did before recombining them into new and improved species [*]Consider a staircase module that allows going up or down a level without being akwardly tucked in some corner. [*]Add a power display that's readable in world. Right now if you want to figure out if you have power to run another machine you need to open the power console. But you can somehow display global terraforming values on a big TV [*]Adjust the size of the outdoor platform to be in line with the hab modules and allow them to snap to each other. Allow the launch pad to snap to existing structures as well. [*]Allow hab modules to intersect the terrain to a small degree (you would absolutely do some landscaping before going ""can't possibly fit this building here because of a bucket worth of sand"") or require outdoor platforms as foundations.",0.7611655592918396

I have one neutral thing and positive thing to start with: I can see why a lot of people rate this game highly: the devs very effectively trigger the ""number go up!"" endorphin rush by showing you five different point scales that you can make rapidly change to bigger numbers. This is definitely crack for gamers, and quite satisfying, but also super grindy. In addition, to add the positive comment, it *is* very satisfying in the early game to see the lakes and rivers fill up and the terrain start to change color. That's some clever coding and makes for a very engaging early game. See the bottom for the rest of my updated opinion after ~16 more hours. Reviews on Steam aren't about whether a game is *good*. They're about whether you would *recommend* a game. And while it's a relaxing little time-waster for a lot of people, for anyone looking for a real open world survival game, this one has potential but you'll be happier if you pass. This is an early access review, and maybe things about the game will change but for now, let's look at what's here. What initially breaks the game is a sense of inevitability of everything: the map is fixed, your initial location is fixed, and you're very definitely on rails. The first two are right out of the Subnautica playbook. The last one definitely is *not*. The blueprint system is built around how you meet goals given to you by previous blueprints. In short, your build order has been set for you by the developers and you will only be allowed to build what the devs will allow you to build, and in exactly the order they allow you to build them. And this is true even if you are experienced with the map and you know where everything is. This is not at all like Subnautica, where an experienced player can rush to the exact blueprints they want and start building specific items right away. Nope. Even if you find uranium early (for example), you will be sitting on it until the game *allows* you to use it. Until that moment, it's a rock that is useless to you and will clog your storage. In addition, most of the tension of a good survival game is drained out of the proceedings right away. There's an exploration element, and you initially need oxygen to survive. Great, that's right out of every survival game handbook. The problem is that oxygen generation in this one is completely trivial: if you build a one room hut with basic materials you can find anywhere, then build a door for it, you have instant oxygen recharge anywhere you want it. I worried about oxygen until I realized this, then I would just build a hut next to each of the game's wrecks, loot them from top to bottom in one trip, just building more storage cabinets in the hut to hold it all, then ferried it all back to base. There's also an absurd unreality layered over everything. In addition to the instant/unlimited oxygen huts, let's look at power. The first power generation blueprint you get is for a wind turbine. Did I mention that you've been stranded on a planet initially with no atmosphere? Yet somehow, the wind turbine still works. A bit later, you get solar panels. These work fine at night. Frequently, the planet is blasted by meteor swarms. Don't worry about repairing your buildings: they can take as many direct meteor hits as needed and indeed you'll *want* the meteors to hit your buildings so you don't have to walk far to collect their contents. (Tip: build two doors to your main base. I had a meteor hit the door of my base scattering debris that I couldn't move through for a few minutes, keeping me from entering.) Resources are unlimited but scattered VERY widely, so you'll spend your time going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, ferrying the more key items for advancement in an ever-larger backpack. But since basic resources are unlimited, you can just sit back, fire this ""game"" up, and watch a ""Terraforming Index"" and a few other metrics climb and climb and climb, occasionally dumping a new blueprint on you. After a certain point, you'll get the distinct impression that eventually the numbers will climb (if slowly) high enough to make you successful without you having to do anything. There are blueprint boxes you can find in the game, but these drop non-required QOL sort of items, again in exactly the order the devs want you to have access to them. Sooooo... yeah. It's a ""dad game"" version of an open world survival game. Maybe some of this will get toned down over the course of development (for example, right now, plant seeds will sprout an unlimited number of times, giving you unlimited food -- the devs have said that this might not be the case in the final game), but the sense of inevitable progression on rails is baked right into the core concept here. So if you're looking for real open world survival game creativity, I'd point you to either Astroneer or the newly available early access game Occupy Mars, or of course either or both Subnautica games if you haven't played those. The Planet Crafter isn't *bad*. There are some good ideas here! But it's very much ""dad's survival game"". EDIT: Okay, +16 hours or so and I still stand by most everything above. If anything, the ""you can only build in X order"" only gets worse in the mid to late game (I progressed well into the insect stage and the gaps between new build items gets wider and wider). That said, you know the bit where I say the blueprints you find in boxes are non-required QOL items? NOPE! One of them is critical to advance the story of the game... and it's FAARRRRR down the ""optional"" blueprint order. So in addition to my notes above, the game also has a very grindy RNG-fest as you have to cast far and wide to find those little blueprint boxes, which just adds *another* layer of frustration to the proceedings. So yeah. Still not recommended. There's some clever ideas here, but watch a couple of play-through videos and that'll give you the gist and you can keep your money. 6/10",0.742561101913452148

Planet Crafter is a game with big ideas! You're taking an entire map that's so barren and orange/red it hurt my eyes at times, and turning it into something lush and honestly pretty striking at times! It's very fun and rewarding to watch the map transform. The gameplay(and indeed, much of the game design itself) borrows from Subnautica; you explore, you gather resources, you build your base, you make the world your own. Instead of finding the unique flora and fauna like in Subnautica, you get to put it there yourself! Many of my issues with this game, and why I will not be finishing it despite being a stone's throw away from the finish line and ending, stem from technical issues and an apparent lack of polish that I originally thought was attributed to the early-access state of the game. Now that we're at a full release, I feel that the game is far too unstable. Hitches, freezes, and an apparent memory leak that caused my entire computer to lock up on multiple occasions made playing the game more stressful than rewarding or fun, because I was always worried about saving as early and often as possible to protect my progress(which is largely just based on waiting real-world time for your terrformation values to tick up) from the inevitable crashes. The map is full of holes. I found a gap in the geometry within a 15-second walk from the spawn point that allowed me to clip under the rocks. The game evidently makes a lot of concessions to maintain performance; one of these concessions is very aggressive LOD and occlusion culling of basically everything. Map geometry, player-placed buildings, even the plants that you grow will very obviously pop in and out of existence as you are moving to and fro. The lay of the land is hard to get a grasp on because of how drastically the environment changes as you travel; something I thought was just a bare hill that would allow me to access another part of the map is actually blocked by a huge cliff that simply popped into existence when I got close enough. It's jarring, confusing, and immersion-breaking. Another comparison to Subnautica is hardly fair here; those guys had the advantage of an ever-present underwater fog to hide what they were doing in the distance, but they also had the environments and objects fade in and out rather than simply appearing and disappearing. I don't want to make assumptions, but it feels very much like higher-quality assets and systems were added onto the very shaky foundation built by the team working on this game when they were much more amateur as developers. One example of this I feel is the lack of a proper day-night cycle. The skybox is eternally static, and ""night"" is signified by the game cranking down the exposure without changing how anything is lit. It's strange and doesn't feel like something that should have passed any kind of a quality check for the 1.0 release, which is a statement that I unfortunately feels like applies to many things about this game. I hope that some day I can return to this game and properly finish it without the pains of the current version. If you love survival-craft games, this is probably still worth a try. If you love having a smooth and well-polished experience, this game is not for you.",0.700309872627258301

Pro: * Solid survival-crafting basics. * Terraforming progress is reflected in the world. Easily the best feature. * Large map filled with lots interesting set pieces. For an early-access game there is a surprising amount of terrain to explore. * By default (see below) there is a very natural progression curve. Tech is tied to your terraforming progress, so you have to start small and work your way up. You also have to explore to access higher tech because the default start location has only basic resources nearby. Con: * Base-building is very constrained. Clipping restrictions are much too harsh; you're basically forced to build a base that floats at least a few inches off the ground, because the smallest intersection with the ground blocks construction. And don't even try to build near interesting terrain: every rock formation or wreckage has a gigantic exclusion box. * Alternate start locations are highly unbalanced. The alternate start positions drop you right next to advanced resources and let you blaze through the tech tree. * The lighting system is just bad. Different biomes have unique shaders, which is fine. The problem is that they apply based on player position - so if you cross the boundary into purple-land, and look backwards, suddenly everything behind you is purple! This is particularly bad inside crashed spaceships when everything suddenly turns pitch black because you stepped over the ""inside"" line. * Generally poor UI/UX. It's better than it was in the demo, but the menu still looks like it was created in 20 minutes for a game jam, and the inventory and crafting screens aren't much better. * The story... doesn't exist yet, and the placeholders are laughably bad writing. I would honestly rather see ""Captain's log: BAD THING HAPPENED"" than what's currently there.",0.694913208484649658

First of all, there's no friction here. In Subnautica, one was forced to go further out beyond the reef and deeper into the abyss to find crafting materials and blueprints, which meant facing your fears, girding your loins, having your wits about you. In this game, not only do the blueprints come to you via your research module, the materials come to you too, via meteor storms (with incredibly weak-sauce impacts). Even when you do explore, there's so little to see; this game lacks all the visual and stylistic richness of Subnautica. The sound design is absolutely dead.

It has the bones for a great, unique survival crafter - but the actual experience of play is not engaging enough in early access to warrant a purchase. Maybe given future updates where there is a more dynamic state of play. POSITIVES: The hand-crafted environment changes procedurally as you make progress, creating a unique sense of earned progression - I think the developers should expand on this dynamic phase-based sense of play, where you feel incentivized to restructure your base at every phase of the planet, or at least add more exploration options as the environment changes (like new resources that appear at every phase in places like underwater caverns, etc). The crafting and tech progression are intermingled in a way that both feels natural and plays well, requiring you to diversify your play and base-building. The game incentivizes exploration, as searching nooks and crannies will reveal valuable rewards that increase quality of play - movement options, extra resources, special items, etc. NEGATIVES: The game feels rather empty, with no living creatures and exactly one type of dynamic event (meteor storms). Otherwise, it's you and the vastness of a lifeless, static environment. The lack of dynamic events removes a lot of survival pressure. Your #1 enemy is your Oxygen meter, which is a basic timer requiring you to either visit a base or have Oxygen tanks. Very little in this game will actually pose a survival threat to you, and in early phases it's simply inconvenient as you have about 60 seconds to mine materials & base-build before dipping into an interior space for air. I've died a handful of times and it has literally always been to running out of oxygen because I mistimed how long it would take me to walk back from an expedition. The game systems are not that deep. You place structures that contribute to the environment in different ways, then at certain ecological milestones, more structures will unlock. Sometimes the structures will add complexity to the system, but more often than not, they just require more advanced materials, take more energy, and contribute more to the environment. While you do automate some aspects, it's limited - you will be in endgame mining ""advanced"" materials the way you were mining starter materials at the very beginning. The story is bare-bones and simply not compelling. Comparable games like Satisfactory have a similarly bare-bones story, but the depth of systems in those games adds value to the point where the story is not necessary to enjoy the game.",0.651757895946502686

Resource gathering is essential to the game but it feels so cheap because you are not breaking down rocks or digging to get to the materials but just picking them up off the ground. The material recipes for many things don't make any sense. Want to build a nuclear reactor? Well that will be 2 water bottles and a uranium rod.

Until it reaches a certain value terraforming complete and end of the game. The core gameloop is running arround the map gathering resources. And build a infrastructure wich let's the counters run faster. The more you wan't the counters to tick faster the more you run arround. To create some difficulty. You have 3 slow your progress down counters. Oxygen, water and food, these counter's decrease that quick that you are almost non stop busy get food get water, Furthermore is the map small(although Raptor stated it's HUGHE). And the map is in a highly unfinished state and is poorly modeled. People compare it to Subnautica .... yes but no. The concept of the game is really great, and for a couple wich develops this game , they get my fullest sympathy. But the current state is not worth the 16+ euro's. Stardew valley took 5 years of development by oe person. And we are talking about a 2d game with way more simple game mechanics. To finish this game it will take at least 6 years. And I don't see that happening for various reasons. One of the most important things this game lack's. Is what made Firewatch and Subnautica a success. Narration integrated with the gameplay. Furthermore gamemechanics that let you work together with a real person or NPC wich is terraforming another planet and helping each other out. The map needs overall remodeling. And the the lifesupport mechanics rebalancing. Building a base in mid air? More can be said you get the point and i am not going to do there work. GAMEPLAY PRO-TIP Don't plays Tree and Flower seeders arround your base. There are regularly meteor showers and Uranium and Indium are easy to find. But when you have the much needed Super Alloy meteor showers. They despawn after a short period of time and you can't find them between the tree's and flowers.

It’s ok, I enjoyed playing it for the most part, but it is seriously lacking in a lot of key areas for a survival game. Pros: • Overall the game was engaging for a survival type game. • Concept is great. • Stages of terraforming felt well thought out. Cons: • It either needs to be a “Story line” survival game (i.e. Subnautica) or a “builder” survival game (i.e. Seven Days to Die). This is neither. • Lacks any real story. There’s a very vague story line, but it feels tacked on and more of an afterthought. • The progression is off. Some things come quickly some take hours if in game grinding to make any real progression on. • World is really small. If I had to guess, it’s probably about 1/8 the size of what the Subnautica map was. • Graphics are outdated, about 10 years older than current generations. • No real environmental threats. No hostile enemies or hazardous zones. With a proper eye on the bars, you will never die. Hopefully the full release will change a few things. It would be nice to have some sort of procedurally generated world, or new worlds to terraform or something to keep you engaged.

I hope the game developers use the cash injection to really work on this product to flesh it out further which could make this game really good. As others have said, try the demo, the demo is representative of the first 10 hours of play. It is similar in flavour of sub nautica. Do the calculation of 10 hours of good game for the price tag of your country and see if that is of good value, the demo is maybe the first 3-4 hours(the save carries over from demo to full game) EARLY GAME Pacing is good, feels good to travel around and explore, you only need a few of the machines and you just upgrade them as you unlock newer versions, which keeps progress going. Since its minimal management on that end, you can explore while the number ticks up. Exploration is alright, I will say some places can be very hard to find, as they can be just a tiny ladder in a corner, but all the main monuments are...pretty basic, go in, break barrier, take loot, go home. you go in and out maybe 3 times to collect all the loot. LATE GAME When you get to around the 10 hour mark, you have unlocked all the terraforming equipment, at least most of it. at that point in the game you just unlocked something for like lets say 10,000 points, that means in 10 hours you generated 10,000 points, the next unlock is like 10,000,000 points, so it goes from a game of unlocking stuff and exploring into a game of 'okay time to get to work' and you just have to start crafting a bunch of the drills and heaters and such to start bumping all your numbers up. The problem with this is getting materials, right now to obtain the mid/late game materials, you have two options after draining the map of them, you 'summon' them from rockets, which you don't get a ton of the resources and its a manual process of going to go collect all the resources, it just isn't really 'fun' its just a chore, collect materials to build rocket, send rocket,wait for rocks, keep rough track of where they all land, go mine the rocks, repeat process. It also doesn't help that the rockets require the same resources that they are dropping, so if you collect 20 red ore, you have to use 6 to get another rocket, so you only really got 14, while spending maybe 30 minutes doing so. The alternative is ore drills, these would be great, if not for one flaw, you place this in specific areas to get specific materials, sounds great, put the ore drill in the red cave to get red ore, sounds easy enough. The problem is these ore miners have limited space, lets say like 15, now 15 of red ore would be great, the problem is the miners don't collect JUST the red ore, they collect maybe 1 red ore for every 4 'junk' ore and you are left with 3 red ore after it has mined for 10-20 minutes. These ore miners are not super easy to make, they take a long time to fill up, and they get filled with junk, but they are the only way to get some materials like aluminium, so you are forced to act like an errand boy, going from drill to drill, collecting resources, and dumping the junk ore into storage(or on the floor in a giant pile) This is a pretty annoying part of the game, but the good thing is, it is an easy fix from the developers. I want the drill to just drill what I need, If I want junk ore, I can put the drill in a 'common' area and get it that way, I don't want this mix of ores. To add onto this, because the drills have to be in specific areas, those areas are pretty far apart, even with max level jets and such, just going back and forward so many damn times, I've spent most my time doing just that. If the devs take the early access money, build up both the story more, the unlocks more and expand the exploration a bit more and maybe add a bit of teleporting so you aren't traveling so damn far to do things, this teleportation would also be good BEFORE the grind wall, so you can get to and from the drills and such easier. overall, try the demo, it made me want to buy the game, but if you are tight for money, maybe hold off another year.",0.628099620342254639

Then, generate oxygen, warmth, and pressure to create a brand new biosphere.",Miju Games,The Planet Crafter,Miju Games,"I'm a huge sucker for survival and base building games, and the idea of throwing terraforming into the mix really appealed to me. When faced with the brain-dead simplicity of the early game, however, I just couldn't bring myself to continue and see whether the changes to the planet were sweet enough to make up for my utter boredom and disappointment. Resource gathering amounted to ""pick up minerals that are scattered around in a roughly even distribution."" No deposits or concentrations, just walking around learning to identify which small rock (that sticks out from the environment like a sore thumb) corresponds to which of the 5 or so minerals you actually need, because you sure aren't going to be able to collect everything - inventory space is extremely limited early on. So you go out and hope that you randomly find the one you're looking for before you run out of oxygen. The sole exception was a particular one that I had to hunt around for, which was probably the most interesting thing I did during my playtime, punctuated by frustration when I realized that I needed a flashlight that I didn't have, so I had to make another tedious trip back to base, burning through my oxygen tanks the whole time. Base building, normally my favorite part of these games, was even more lackluster. I had hoped for a feeling of setting up a complex logistics system on an alien world: laying power cables, fiddling with buttons and wires on panels, managing pressure and atmospheric gases, performing critical maintenance, growing food while on the verge of starving, sweating at the possibility of making a fatal mistake. Instead it's just a matter of unceremoniously plopping down devices that magically provide power, magically dig through rock with no byproducts, magically provide oxygen to your suit, and magically correct the mix of atmospheric gases to something breathable. Oh, and they all magically work forever, unless perhaps one happened to get hit with an odd meteorite - wouldn't know. One you've plopped your first set of magical devices, what do you have to look forward to? Gathering more minerals to plop another set of them, until you unlock the T2 version, and then plopping those down instead. And the scale of my operation barely felt like it would be enough to support myself, let alone make any changes whatsoever to the ecosystem of an entire planet. ""Planet Wizard"" might have been a more apt description here. Graphically I didn't find the game to be up to modern standards. Textures are very flat and frequently don't blend well with whatever they're sitting near. The devices you put down lack a sense of character - that is, being a working machine. Wind turbines simply run at a constant speed forever. Solar panels are static and always clean. Drills barely move. Your own character only interacts with the environment via a tool that does everything. If the gameplay were more interesting it could easily make up for this, but such as it is, it's just another reason to be unenthused about the complete package. Overall, I'd say that if you don't much care about the things I listed above and just think the idea of watching the planet turn from red to green and having life show up (again, magically) is cool, then by all means you may enjoy Planet Wizard- I mean Crafter. If you just like great survival/crafting games, though, the market is flooded with other titles that will respect your time and provide a more rewarding experience",0.631703019142150879

The start feels like a good survival game, then this gradually gets easier, surviving becomes very easy/not a part of the game at about 7 hours in, then you start automating the mining process, all of this was great. Now though, I look at what is in front of me. Jet-packing between my multiple miners to grab resources (which frustratingly produce multiple other junk resources making this a longer process), to produce things while there is no threat to me/no survival aspect. Satisfactory overcame this by making logistic systems, whereas in this game the next bit will just involve myself moving back and forth a few dozen times. So I'm staring into the last 5 hours of this game finding little enjoyment at this last leg of the journey. What worries me too is that the developers are planning on extending this portion of the game (making amphibians, insects, etc.) but there is no puzzle, no chance of failure, just plug in hours and get said answer. The initial thrill of the game came from the challenging survival, short lengths of time you can survive outside, prioritising the way through the puzzle with the interesting story. But more needs to be done to make the second phase more interesting because sadly it is slightly boring due to the repetitiveness.",0.618467450141906738

After being burned by Early Access games never completing, I can only judge games by how they are at the moment, rather than what they promise to be in the future. The short and sweet is that there isn't really much to do. You can go explore to search for materials to bring back to base, set up terraforming stuff, repeat. Add in a basic food and water need system and that's most of what you're dealing with. Graphics work well enough but there's a lot of pop-in and terrain that isn't properly set up so you can see through the world, audio is okay, etc. It's just in a really early stage right now. The devs' way of getting you to explore often comes down to resource scarcity, but the main issue I have with that method is that I end up never wanting to engage with the exploration except for small, targeted excursions to grab exactly the materials I need and come back. There's also no easy way to send materials back to base for long expeditions, so once you're full on materials, you might as well stop exploring then and there. The feature I want most is some basic automation. Nothing insane like Factorio inserters and autocrafters or whatever, just the ability to move items from one inventory (like the water collectors) into another (like a shared closet in a more convenient space). Mining drills just aren't all that good when I have to manually collect the materials from every individual one every few minutes, food growers aren't that good when I have to manually harvest the food even though I need a stockpile of some foods for crafting, etc. The game has promise, don't get me wrong. It's just not yet ready to ask for $20. Keyword being ""yet"". So long as the devs don't disappear, I'm sure I'll have to update this review at some point.",0.615167319774627686

I love this game, and will probably continue to play it for a while. It triggers the happy chemicals in my brain that only filling up bars and gauges can. I liken it to Space Survival Melvor Idle. And that's a huge compliment. For Early Access, it's brilliant. But... there's a few - meh notes. The graphics/sound/gameplay loops are decent. Nothing amazing, but solid. Quite enjoyable. I can't fault them for an indy game. So, if I'm going to keep playing, and the game isn't bad - why am I not recommending it? Simply, the game doesn't respect your time. And that dear reader - is my most precious commodity of late. Initially - I was happy to recommend this, but as I wrote that review I realised that fundamental problem, and I'm writing this, hoping that the developers will see it and change stuff (even just options to allow for, or to fix this problem). Now, as is the wont with survival games, you can't go AFK for long periods of time. You die. This is not a problem on it's own. I am quite happy playing survival games, however - as the canny reader may have noted, I likened this game to something else... Melvor Idle. Resource acquisition is gated by tech progression in the game, and not a little either. You need a LOT of resources to make things work - and again - I am totally OK with that style of gameplay in a bubble. As I am okay with things like Dyson Sphere/Factorio or Satisfactory. I have sunk many hours into those. But, your progression is gated by limited resources, so you can't build to your hearts content. Now this would be fine, if I could idle for 20 minutes, have a blast on Speedrunners or Mario Kart or the like with the twins while we play together while waiting on miners to extract their quotas... this would be fine, except it's a survival game. If I idle for twenty minutes, odds are I'm coming back to having died, even if I'm in base. I get that the devs don't want all the resources spammed for everyone all the time and content just zipped through, but there's so many mid game things that are limited in availability that at the end of the day, I can't just spend my day making a base that tickles my fancy up the side of a cliff while spreading my fields of spreaders or collectors, because it's survival, and the two genres in this fashion don't work well together. Individually, they are brilliant, but as it stands currently - there's not enough automation to allow for idle play (as in I have water collectors that can keep me from getting parched, and enough food growing to keep me from dying, but I have to be at the keyboard for this process), but there aren't the resources to allow me to go wild with base building (even incrementally as the fundamental bits are gated hard), so I find myself twiddling my thumbs far too much with this game. Without trying to spoil things, you can't make miners without a certain ore, but even when you get access to that ore initially, there is only such a small quantity available that you can make 1 miner and a bio lab, or two miners. Now you need 2 miners for the resources aluminium and iridium, but you're gated by power concerns as tier 1 miners can't get uranium (and I know there are chests with, but they don't always have enough early on). Now, if I could just wait it out while these resources gathered slowly to build up a stock pile, that'd be fine if I could idle it out, but being made to sit there shows that the developers haven't considered my time as a currency. If they sort this out, I'll gladly change this to a positive review, as overall it's a bloody brilliant game, but I'm struggling the justification of my time for eating/drinking while waiting.",0.615021347999572754

The problem is that you need to have a specific ""main base"" where your bio-lab and rocket setup is because them and the support food growers are too damn expensive to move or build multiples of easily. This is Point A. You will probably use up all the aluminum anywhere near Point A in reasonably short order since solar panels need it, and you will need a lot of those to go along with your terraforming buildings, most of which also need aluminum. Thus, you will need ore extractors for aluminum before too long. Extractors only have a chance of finding aluminum in very specific places. The nearest of these places is Point B. Iridium also can only be found or mined in very specific places, and you also need a lot of it for anything to do with heat or rocketry, which is often. The iridium mine is point C. It will not be terribly close to point B. Sulfur is needed for a lot of biolab stuff, and only comes from Point D. Algae and water from Point E are also needed for most of the biolab stuff. Point E can't be anywhere near points C or D. Trying to build anything new by the ""Moss"" level takes 15 minutes of walking from Point A to Points B, C, D, and E and back to get the raw materials for a single building. And you can't readily replace this with exploration because shipwrecks don't reliably give you things like bio-nuggets, fertilizer, or bacteria samples. It's also complicated by what is the smallest but most damning flaw for me: inventory. The max-level backpack has 35 slots, which isn't even enough to hold all the raw ores/bio-components for one mid-game terraforming building, never mind the solar panels to run it. It's small enough that most shipwrecks or caves will take multiple trips just to bring back the good loot, which can mean spending half an hour just walking back and forth between two already thoroughly-explored locations. Just changing the inventory to have Factorio-style stacks so I don't have to make repeat trips or can leave the miners running for an hour or two instead of needing to empty their stockpile every 15 minutes would probably change my vote to positive.",0.610189437866210938

I think we finally found out what the problem is, and unfortunately if we're right, then it's something that most people who have the issue won't be able to fix. Still, I'm going to explain what I think is causing it and a few things that might help a few people get it to work, and call it quits there. I'll keep an eye on discussions around this issue, and keep trying to get the devs' attention on it, but ultimately, I don't think they'll be able to fix it if they stay with Gameguard. Regardless, if I find a common fix or the devs add it to their list of known issues, I'll probably update this review one last time. Otherwise, I don't plan to. There's a non-exhaustive list of 'fixes' we've already tried that haven't worked for us in the first update down below (if one more person tells me to whitelist it on my antivirus, I'm going to have an aneurysm). NOTE: This pertains to Gameguard failing to update while launching the game. There are two other issues with Gameguard that I've heard people have while looking into this: If you struggle with error 114/Gameguard has a critical error, afaik the devs are aware of it and the only thing you can do is wait for the devs to fix it. Keep an eye on the patch notes. If Gameguard simply won't install for you at all, I haven't heard of any possible fixes and I don't *think* the devs have mentioned anything either. You have my condolences. If you're having this problem (or any problem with Gameguard/the game in general), you can open a support ticket at https://arrowhead.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new, or send an email to their support team at support@arrowheadgs.com. I don't think we'll hear back from them, which is understandable since I bet they're swamped, but if enough people report the issue, they might notice it. I'm only one player out of a few hundred thousand. SO: Gameguard failing to update *seems* to be caused by either a network/service provider or their firewall blocking Gameguard. One reason why we think that, is there are posts on GG's forums dating back to 2005 acknowledging it. If it's your home firewall, that's an easy fix. Unfortunately for most people with this problem, it isn't their firewall specifically. It's people living on campuses or renting that can't actually turn off the firewall for their network, because they don't have access to it. One person said they were able to get in using a VPN, but that didn't work for most of us. Another used the mobile hotspot on their phone, but for the few it worked for, it also requires playing the game on your hotspot, which wasn't exactly feasible for us. That said, those are the only things I've heard that have had any success at all. You can try any or all of the steps that failed for the rest of us that are listed below, but I wouldn't put much hope in those. But there's also a much bigger problem with this: IT CAN HAPPEN AT ANY TIME. It DOESN'T happen immediately upon launching Helldivers for the first time. I played from thurs-sat without issue. Since the issue first occured on Sunday, it hasn't gone away. Not only that, I did contact my network provider and got them to shut off the firewall for a second, and the game actually booted! (which is one of the main reasons why we think most people having this issue are having it). So you may think 'okay, Gameguard updated, so you can play again until the next update'. But that's not actually correct. They turned the firewall back on, I closed the game and reopened it, and you guessed it, no launch, and haven't been able to since. Someone replied to one of my forum posts an hour or two ago that they'd been playing for a few days, and this just happened to them today and they're still locked out too. So that means IF THIS PROBLEM ARISES AFTER YOU PLAY FOR 2 HOURS, which is has for most of us, you are SoL. - 3rd update: Unfortunately, simply updating via the mobile hotspot then returning to the network doesn't actually work. You need to remain on the hotspot the entire time you're playing the game. So, back to square one once again. Thank you, devs. I'm having *so* much fun right now trying to fix an issue that hundreds if not thousands of people are having that *you* could fix by simply switching anticheats. What a strange hill to die on. - 2nd update: A kind heroic random suggested this to me on discord: ""my firend lives in a studen area where his network provider blocks alot of stuff like nsfw websites for example, i read on gameguard website that if your network provider blocks alot of stuff its becasue of it you get the error code. conact your network provider it said, so i said to my friend conect to your phone hotspot and try to launch the game and it worked. spread this messege pls its on of the big reasons. this anticheat are ♥♥♥♥ and i dont know why they use it."" It worked for me, so anyone else having this issue, give it a shot and let me know if it works for you too. I'll revert the review to positive again if i find out this is a widespread fix. Until then, I'll continue to fight for my brothers that have lost their Helldivers to this anticheat until something more comes of it. Sidenote: This isn't a fix for GG error 114. Afaik, it's a similar but different problem that the devs are aware of and looking into. The only advice i've heard for that so far has been to wait until they fix it. So, yeah, even if my particular problem with GG has been solved, it's far from the only problem this anticheat has been causing people. - Update: I reviewed the game positively originally because it was working fine for the most part and the fun was worth the bugs. But since Sunday, I haven't been able to launch the game because Gameguard refuses to update for no discernible reason. I and a growing number of others plagued with this problem have been trying everything to get it to work over the past 3 whole days or at least get the devs to acknowledge it as a problem that they'll look into, but so far it's been radio silence and no one has found a fix yet. Some examples of things that we've tried so far that have been unsuccessful: Uninstalling and reinstalling both GG and HD2 Whitelisting in our AVs Reinstalling with both antivirus and firewall turned off Reinstalling/running as an administrator Using a different network to install Turning off all other programs that might be interfering Verifying the integrity of the game files Doing a system restore Opening an official support ticket So far, none of those have worked. I just want the devs to acknowledge this problem that a growing number of people are having (that is in no way related to the one GG problem they already did acknowledge) so i know this is getting looked into, and that we arent just SoL. ------------- You can actually catalog my descent into madness trying to fix GG from me being all happy and nice and perky about it in my first post on sunday to all the other posts and replies and updates I've made through the past 3 days getting gradually more and more worn down and pissy turning into incoherent ramblings from scouring the internet for youtube guides and forum posts and nigh-20yo outdated official faqs and messing around with stuff on my computer i didn't even know existed until now I have no memory of the sun and don't know if i'll ever see my family again unless gameguard decides to fix itself and update so i can return to enjoying the crashes with the rest of you",0.803368687629699707

(*armor carries perks, theres only so many armor perks in the game and all of them can be acquired for free. thus while you can use MTX to acquire perks 'early' they are not exactly stat items.) the reason this pisses me off is that in the post where this was announced, a line i have come to mockingly quote regularly is posted: ""Do you hate FOMO? We do!"" yes, you sure do, you hate fomo so much you had fomo preorder bonuses, you hate fomo so much you have a rotating storefront encouraging people to keep eyes on unless they miss out on something. you hate fomo so much that your special edition has a arcade cabinet that is in your ship nomatter what and only works if you fork the 20 dollars over for it to work. this particular point has been sticking with me for a while, the direct ""look at how cool and generous we are uwu"" bragging followed within seconds by more predatory bullshit makes me genuinely nervous, and is the primary factor as to why i give this a thumbs down. if you've read all this, firstly thank you for taking the time to hear my rambling out and consider my opinion. secondly, if you've read what im upset about and you do not feel that it would bother you, you think that this would be a particularly fantastic co-op game with your friends, etc. do not let me hold you back, please. i really do enjoy this game, and the reason im making this negative review is to express what can be improved for the sake of this being an even better game.",0.786895215511322021

This is such a fun game, but if the torrent of actual security professionals who work in IT screaming that this is malware you cant even remove from your pc isn't enough to dissuade you, I just have to add my voice to the chorus of warnings that you shouldnt EVER install this game until that's been removed.

I played it for about 100 hrs on steam, and another 100 back on PS4 Let me run down what I dislike about this game. Strategem and weapon upgrades are gone. All weapons are as good as they'll ever be. Samples are instead used for permanent ship upgrades, however, it takes a long time. I'm very mixed on permanent, global upgrades in Helldivers, as the ""You are as good as your gear"" mechanics does feel really nice. Weapons take forever to unlock. We're stuck in solo while the game launched broken, so we have to unlock weapons this way too. Each mission is 15-20 minutes, after 4 hrs I unlocked 1 pistol and 2 primaries. They're going to get exponentially harder to unlock from here. Weapons are less special, more shooty, however, they ""made up for it"" In Helldivers 1, lots of weapons got their own elemental upgrades. The Double Barrel had dragonbreath, the Paragon had toxic, and lots of low-cal weapons like the Knight got a bit of AP, or stun. In Helldivers 2, there is a paid battle pass for a flame version of a different gun. It sucks, bad. Vehicles are gone too. No more APC, Tank, Mecha or Bike. It's a shame. The matchmaking is broken. I'm not one to really use SOS instant matchmaking but I tried to today many times, on full game servers, to no avail. It's broken. Edit; matchmaking is no longer broken. The Illuminate are gone. There's now only two factions, Bugs and cyborgs. This sucks because the illuminate had a harsher stealth and shield based gameplay that led to interesting fights. Microtransactions are here. Which sucks. They have paid and free battle pass sections. The paid one has unique elemental guns, as said above. Edit: they're not THAT bad. still not great. Finally, the anticheat is very aggressive. What's here is fun. The shooting feels nice. But there's just too many issues to deal with right now. Edit: I want to make it clear that all the in mission gameplay is good. It's VERY good. The problem is everything else around that in-mission gameplay. Further Edits: The game is buggy. Very buggy. Connection problems, my shops broke, both the premium one, the battle pass, and strategem shops. I have a 1 in like 5 chance for the game to work. I now have a small chance to be unable to use terminals. I also sometimes get teleported to the sky unable to do anything.",0.74115908145904541

Planetside is great, progression is pretty good if not grindy but a little bit of grind doesn't spoil the bunch for me.

That is unfathomably cringe, and there is a special place in hell for whoever came up with the idea, peer reviewed it, coded it, and then put it in an otherwise great game. This blew up! So i'm gonna specify some things. The premium pass is locked behind a premium currency. You can claim this premium currency through a free pass that holds normal armor, weapons, perks, and equipment. You can also find this premium currency rarely in missions. The biggest issue I have with this, is the slogging grind you'll have to do to unlock the pass, many people wont have the time to unlock the premium pass and miss out. It encourages you to spend money on the pass to skip out on the grind. An ugly ""P2W"" mechanic in a great game.

That being said, the anti-cheat software they decided to use in this game is probably one the worst. I've known about it for a long time as it was used in a popular Asian MMO I used to play for years. Even in under an hour, the anti-cheat software managed to close two programs I really need to use on my PC, and they don't interact with the game at all yet this software decided to control my PC and close them. The fact that they decided to go with this specific one is really bizarre to me, but oh well. Though... I don't think the software is as dangerous as people claim it to be, however it does like to control specific things on your PC without your immediate, direct consent. As is pretty commonly talked about when you look this anti-cheat software up, it does indeed not fully uninstall I've found. It will remain and do things. There is legitimately zero good reason for this. If it were about whether or not the user is going to re-install a game that utilizes that same anti-cheat, then the files should remain dormant, not running, until that condition is met. But that is not the case here for who knows what reason. If you don't particularly care about a game's anti-cheat potentially going behind your back and closing things just because it wants to, then by all means get the game and enjoy it, because it's a great game. Otherwise, don't even try it because the software will hook itself in and you'll have to research the potentially long process of scrubbing it from your OS. Only real way I'm going to pick this game back up is if a friend really wanted to play it together because we'd have fun, I'd just have to deal with the anti-cheat closing things randomly.",0.726917386054992676

Shoot your way through relentless waves of vicious horrors with high-octane objectives, upgrading steampunk weapons, collecting Celtic God powers, and surviving the onslaught of the Quiet Ones.",Wales Interactive,Sker Ritual,Wales Interactive,"TL;DR Cannot recommend game in its current state. Game has potential and an interesting premise but balancing issues and tedious objectives leave much to be desired. The premise for this game is an interesting idea (in theory): take a wave-based shooter and explicitly make the game about completing objectives instead of only killing enemies like say in Killing Floor (KF had some objective-based maps but they were never the focus nor that popular). The single biggest problem with this game right now is the balancing and scaling. You start with a pistol and can buy from a limited selection of weapons at trader(s) at fixed points on each map. Each weapon can be upgraded, and potentially infinitely except the cost of upgrades scales very fast. The first upgrade for a weapon costs 5k, the second 15k, the third 30k, the fourth 50k, and the fifth 100k. You earn a fixed amount of money for killing an enemy, with headshot kills earning slightly more. Each wave also scales enemy health and quantity at a considerable rate. A single headshot from the pistol on the first wave is enough to kill an enemy, but 3 headshots will be required by wave 3-4. In order to not get overwhelmed by enemies, you probably want to upgrade your primary weapon every ~5-6 waves, which quickly becomes unrealistic after the first 1-2 upgrades as enemies will become very bullet spongey and deplete your ammo reserves much faster, often requiring you to pay for a refill of ammo every wave, and the refill cost also scales as you upgrade your weapon (1.7k for a t3 weapon vs ~250 for a t1 weapon). The game also has a respawn mechanic in the form of life tokens, which allow you to revive yourself or a teammate. You start with one life token (can only ever have 1) and it costs 5k base to buy another one, and each subsequent token costs 2.5k more so 7.5k, 10k, etc. This means if you start getting overwhelmed by the enemies, you will start spending a considerable amount of money on life tokens and that makes getting your weapon upgraded so you can try to catch up even harder, and often impossible. On the whole, I've often found that in order to complete a level, it's often necessary to play the level several times to figure out what you actually need to do on that level and then try to speedrun it to complete it as fast as possible before the scaling gets to a point that you get overwhelmed. This brings me to my next biggest gripe which are the objectives. One of the biggest problems with this game are that objectives vary wildly in both difficulty to complete and also just figuring out how you're even supposed to accomplish the objective at all. Some objectives will give you nice clear objective markers at least of where to go on the map while other objectives will require you to explore and run around the map frantically while trying to figure out what the text is actually trying to get you to do. On the most recent map, Sewers of the Dead, for example, there was an objective where three moving targets needed to be shot in a sequence that was indicated by a prop in the environment. We shot the targets over and over in the correct sequence, making attempts that spanned at least 20 minutes, before we finally must've done something somehow different (even though we just shot the targets in sequence yet again) that caused the objective to actually be completed. This particular objective was also incredibly annoying as the targets were on a tower that goes high up in the air and if you get hit, your aim is going to be knocked about by aim punch, so we ended up in a familiar song and dance we often find ourselves doing on these levels which is killing every enemy except for 1 and having one player kite that enemy while the other tries to figure out the objective. The game eventually despawns the enemy after a certain amount of time (probably 3-5 minutes?) but it's the only strategy we've really found for trying to figure out objectives that are unclear like this. Some of the objectives are just plain tedious. An objective that appears in some form on every map is to kill x number of enemies while you stand in a (small) circle on the map, which will require killing something like 80-100 enemies. As the waves increase, the number of enemies per wave increases and so you often end up stuck in this loop where you kite enemies around, stop momentarily in the circle, killing some enemies, and then run away and kite before you get overwhelmed. There's just no reason the objective needs to require killing as many enemies as it does - halving the number of kills required would be a very welcome change. Another tedious objective that was specific to this map was to escort an npc from one side of the map to the other. The NPC didn't actually follow the players however - you had to pay it a small sum ($500?ish) and then it would activate for either a short amount of time (~5 seconds) or a fixed, small distance it would traverse before it would shut down and you'd have to activate it again. This probably took around 5-10 minutes to complete and cost a non-trivial amount of money. Sometimes we'd activate the npc only to have it basically not move at all or literally take 1-2 steps and it wasn't clear why that was - a best guess was maybe if enemies were nearby it would move a much shorter distance? The last level released before Sewers of the Dead, The Ashes of Sker Hotel, also had an objective that required escorting multiple npcs but in that objective at least, the npcs would simply follow the player so it didn't take overly long to complete and there was a nice push and pull between trying to keep the npcs in line of sight so they would follow you and not getting overwhelmed; that same push and pull just felt frustrating in comparison with the npc on Sewers of the Dead as how far it went was completely out of your control. This game definitely has potential to be a game I'd highly recommend but until the balance, scaling, and objective clarity/tedium is fixed, I cannot recommend picking this game up. That's unfortunate as the setting is very dark and unique with some interesting enemy designs (and some incredibly annoying enemy designs like enemies that instantly teleport behind you every time you shoot them, seemingly with no cooldown). Follow it to see what updates are made if you're interested and hopefully the developer can make some positive changes in this regard.",0.673410236835479736

Don't misunderstand me, the concept and idea is great and I love the fact that this is sort of a L4D/Killing floor type of game, but if any of you were to buy this game as it is I'm pretty sure that the boredom will come crawling pretty quickly. It's fine for a couple of games, or you can even test your patience and reach ten matches but at the eleventh one you'll probably start searching for another game to kill some time while this gets updated with any new content. If you also count that there are two achievements in which you have to stay alive for 35 rounds and 50 rounds, I even wonder who actually did these two (surely friends because solo's I doubt). I honestly tried it, so hard, but after reaching the 21 round every time I just simply quit because I get bored. Just sitting there, waiting, killing, repeating.. you know by now that yes, after a while it gets boring (after repeating this so many times). The problem lies also in the fact that the grind is real, the normal difficulty for this game it's not rewarding at all because for doing at least one level of the ""sker pass"" you have to play at least two times or if things gets worse, even three times, doing the same and only available map, same objectives and so on. The only thing that can make a difference and maybe make everything more interesting, is the fact that right at the start of the match you can choose to increase the difficulty of the level and raise the bar really high. There's also another level, expert I assume but I didn't try it because the hard mode indeed was already challenging for me. Still, it's not enough and I doubt you want to start already at hard mode (but if you're a masochist go ahead, it's great). I just hope that they will bring new content soon and rework the overall grind because it's not really great.",0.509844958782196045

The mountain biome is nothing but grass. - Hunting animals is a pain in the ass; there are no stealth mechanics. You can't crouch; you can only walk slower, but that does nothing to increase your stealthiness. - Most of the buildings are just a small rework of the same building (a wooden tent). - It's painfully slow to walk anywhere, and God forbid you're out at night outside your village, and the innkeeper is no longer there to pass the night. - The most annoying thing is that when you're deeply developing your settlement and finally unlock the Village Hall, you need to be far away from any village to be able to build the Village Hall. So now all your work is useless because you have to relocate to another spot to be able. So be sure to be far away from any village. - Clearing bandit camps is not even worth the effort; the reward is minimal, with the only useful item being the strap. - Sitting on top of a rock renders you invincible; the NPCs won't be able to attack you unless there is an archer. - Dying while reading a book destroys all the progress in learning that skill as well as the book, so you are pretty much forced to avoid any kind of combat during that time. - The quests are as boring as finding me X item and going to talk with Y person. - The mechanics of the inventory are trash; each item takes up one spot. Say you have 2 rocks; they're going to use up 2 spots. 2 mushrooms will use up 2 spots, and so on. - Fighting a shield man with a bow is impossible; it doesn't matter if he is in a block stance, he will ignore the damage from every arrow, even if you hit him in exposed areas. - Wolves will literally follow you half a map before giving up; it's plain stupid. - Your villagers are very easy to kill no matter the equipment, so think twice before throwin them to battle, especially if you have high skill ones. At this point for this price I can not recommend this game despite its potential.

Robotic, lifeless, monotone, and they get used way to frequently. Lack of control customization, poor optimization. Not a big surprise for EA but noteworthy.

I believe it's actually copied from their abandonware Last Oasis, but I can't be 100% sure because I noped out of that garbage game pretty quickly. It's also incredibly clunky due to the shit animations, and honestly feels much closer to an asset flip game than anything produced by a reputable developer. Unfortunately, it's also not something that can be improved upon without starting over from scratch so don't expect it to become better down the road. Other then that, it seems like a fairly standard, somewhat grindy, open world survival crafting game. It has a companion and city management system as well but it's not even worth mentioning.

If you have no problems with losing hours of progress to unfair PvP with your pals, you will likely get a great degree of fun and memories from this game. When I heard the news regarding PvE servers, I was ecstatic. Sure, the promised nerfs to gameplay were appallingly foolish, but I figured there would be some kind of 'come-to-jesus' moment where the devs realized what was obvious to the rest of the world; that people are significantly more interested in having pirate adventures with their friends than dealing with sweaty PvP. Fast forward to today, and I am disappointed. Rare, please, for the love of all that is holy, wake the hell up. Instead of punishing PvE players for wanting to enjoy a game, you should instead perhaps give additional rewards to those who still want to PvP, if that. I can't even take my captained ship with my friends that I slaved over? To hell with that. To newcomers who are attracted by the PvE; you should wait. As it stands, the game will treat you as a second-class citizen, and you will be disappointed by all the things you can't enjoy. I have full confidence that, with time, Rare will eventually make the right decision. As a message to the PvPers out there; I am in no way indicting you for your fun. It's cool that you guys enjoy the game the way you do, but I do hope you understand that there is a significant majority of people who just want to have fun with their friends. I'd like it if y'all PvPers were given *additional* rewards for your gaming, instead of PvE'ers being punished for theirs. Best of plunders! Edit: On request, here are some of the punitive measures against Safer Seas; 70% Less Gold and Reputation Earned (Entirely) Many Reputations are inaccessible, and the ones that are cap at level 40 No Live Events No Emissary Action No Captained Ships No Guild Support There are others, but they are more reasonable as they specifically pertain to PvP. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edit 2: I want to express my gratitude to all those who connected with this review, and posted your own thoughts. I am glad to see so many people agree with me that this is an issue requiring attention! Sadly, I had to turn off comments, as a subsection of the community could not set aside their toxic behavior. I simply do not have the time necessary to moderate it. I would like to remind everyone that a conversation requires a degree of mutual respect, and simply insulting other people - or arguing in poor faith - not only fails to move the conversation forward, but simply weakens any arguments you may have. You may as well admit that the other side is right. Who exactly do you think, working at Rare for instance, is going to see that behavior and think, ""Yes, that is the player culture we want to foster! Toxicity that pushes all potential customers away""? We can do better.",0.897060275077819824

Dive in with this revised edition of the game, which includes access to digital bonus media.",Rare Ltd,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Xbox Game Studios,"This game is actually very fun. It's got a huge open world to explore and sail through, and if you can get in with some friends it can be a great time. Mechanically, the game is phenomenal and I'd love to sink hundreds of hours into it. But the community is the worst I've seen since League of Legends. I imagine there has to be a tremendous overlap in the player base between them, because it's too depressing to consider that there are THIS many people who are THAT terrible to each other. I haven't been able to sail a single voyage in ages without having someone chase my ship for hours while screaming every slur they know into their awful $10 microphones. I tried to love this game, I really did. Those few times I got to just play with my friends I had a great time. But there is no matchmaking - when you set out, you're up against anyone who might be playing. You can have 10 hours of player time to their thousand. It doesn't matter. And if you're not interested in the PVP aspect? Tough luck, there's no opting out. Most players don't bother with the world events or the voyages, it seems. They just sail around looking for someone who already gathered up their treasure and then chase them for hours. And that's not hyperbole - I've seen players get chased (and have frequently BEEN chased) from one side of the map all the way to the other. It shocks me that someone is still having fun with that, that someone is just THAT dedicated to ruining someone else's time that this is how they spend hours. There's no downside to this style of play, either. I imagine the game encourages it. The sea monsters and AI ships are a lot of fun to fight, but they actually make the toxic community WORSE. If the kraken decides to wrap itself around your ship while someone's attacking you, you're just doomed. The AI will lock onto one target and utterly ignore anything else in the vicinity, usually leaving them free to, once again, scream all the naughty no-no words that their parents don't let them say when they're at home while you slowly die from the combined onslaught of a literal kraken and another player ship. There's no way to coordinate joining a server with your friends' ships already on them to form an alliance together if you wanted to try to just play with friends, either. Rare seemingly attempted to fix this by coming up with community days and community weekends, where rewards were massively increased. This encourages teaming up with others on the server to maximize benefits across the board. This somehow seems to only make the toxic community WORSE. In the entirely of the last community day weekend, I was unable to speak with a single player. Most of them were just screaming - not even words, just screaming incoherently - into their mics while chasing/attacking any ship they could find. The game also has a serious problem with hackers. I can't count the number of times I've seen someone board my ship and stand around getting blasted by shotguns and facetank all of it without moving. Supposedly the game has a report system, but it relies on an Xbox account and requires you to know the person's name. Most hackers I've seen have had incomprehensible names or are just literally nameless, not that it matters because I'M PLAYING ON STEAM AND DON'T USE AN XBOX ACCOUNT. Maybe I just have the worst luck in the world. Maybe there are some decent people to play with out there. But I haven't found them, and I can no longer convince my friends this game is worth playing, so why would I bother playing it without them? This is a great game utterly ruined by a terribly toxic community.",0.892106592655181885

Dive in with this revised edition of the game, which includes access to digital bonus media.",Rare Ltd,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Xbox Game Studios,"Look, I love this game. I really do. But there are serious, fundamental issues with the current implementation of multiplayer. First off- PvP is profoundly unfun for and unfair to small crews and people not dedicated to the PvP grind. Ganking is astoundingly easy, and 100% the meta strategy- all players have the same amount of health and do the same amount of damage, so large crews just fill your boat with more players than you can reasonably fight and spawnkill you until you sink. Overall, the skill floor for this game is way too high, and players self select into groups that make it worse- players who play the game for PvP will naturally become more skilled at PvP than players who play the game for PvE. As such, PvE players are sitting ducks, easy prey. And, even worse- with captaincy, a ship can be ready for a fight in less than a minute. It takes hours to build up a PvE loot stash of any meaningful value. So PvP ships can just throw themselves at PvE ships until they eventually lose- and, let's be real, when you lose you're screwed. They'll cash out immediately. It's way too easy to get Level 5 Reaper. So, as a small-crew PvE player, the game becomes heart-stoppingly stressful. And the devs don't seem to get this- they continue to make running away even harder. Which would be fine in a game where the stakes were lower, but is total crap in a game with enormous stakes and an even enormous-er aggressor advantage. You want to talk about realism? It's realistic that a tiny merchant ship would see a big hulking pirate galleon trudge up from under the horizon and be able to get the hell out of dodge. Second, the ability for anyone- even allies- to backstab you is exciting and interesting on paper, but in practice is just an enormous impediment to camaraderie and community building. If I'm allied with a crew that I can't keep tabs on at all times, and I have any real amount of loot, I just plain can't leave my ship. We can't hang out, can't go on island voyages together- I can't spend time with other players without the risk of being betrayed and sunk. Without any form of loyalty assurance, this game is a profoundly lonely experience- compounded by the astoundingly sparse servers, at least partly limited in density because of the serious threat each new ship represents to your hoard. Is all of this a skill issue? Yes, 100%. I'll be the first to admit that I'm garbage at PvP. But, frankly, PvP matches as a solo are just so slow, complicated, expensive, and frustrating that I don't have enough IRL time and motivation to commit to the grind. The constant threat of attack is exciting, and vital to the gameplay loop's challenge and significance, but the odds are so far skewed in the aggressor's favor that it's just not fun. Edit: I'm really disappointed by the announcement of Safer Seas. I guarantee that if the fundamental issues with balancing and the gameplay loop were addressed, people wouldn't be clamoring for a PvE mode. Rather than take a good hard look at why people want PvE, they've decided to throw it in there and call it a day. It doesn't solve anything. It just splits the playerbase into the camps of Willing and Not Willing to deal with the existing bad design. And the ability to earn commendations in Safer Seas seriously cheapens them. Why should you be able to earn the Gold Curse or Legendary Hunter of the Sea of Thieves in the ""introductory mode""? Edit 2: They're adding an ""industry leading"" third-party anticheat. Every ""industry leading"" anti-cheat is kernel level, which is beyond invasive and an unacceptable security risk. I really, really hope they reconsider, because otherwise I'm out for good. I'd rather deal with a few snot-nosed script kiddies than sell my digital soul to some company I've never seen. This is genuinely heartbreaking.",0.87922745943069458

Dive in with this revised edition of the game, which includes access to digital bonus media.",Rare Ltd,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Xbox Game Studios,"This game is fun! You probably shouldn't buy it. I know that sounds a bit confusing, so I'll try to clarify. Sea of Thieves has a niche loop: you sail around for a long time, grab some items, put them on your boat, sail some more, and then sell your items. You can buy cosmetic items with the gold you get from selling items, but, surprisingly, the main draw of the game is the loop rather than the reward. I don't think any of this should be fun, but for me, it was - there's an odd, primal satisfaction that comes from grabbing a thing, physically putting it on your boat, and saying this is mine now, and I like to have it. There are a few PvE threats which can get in your way, but they're laughably easy and quite a bore to fight. Nobody plays this game for the PvE; if they're not playing it to fight other players, they're doing to for the weird satisfaction of item collection (or they just really like sailing the boats). The main threat comes from that other group I just mentioned: people who play the game to fight other players. If you're playing the peaceful part of this game (i.e. item collection), you've got to be constantly on your toes and looking out for other players. In fact, the presence of other, frequently hostile players turns this game from a docile sailing game to a really quite intense game of cat-and-mouse. Rocks and trees in the distance begin to look like other ships. You slam against a reef, spring a leak, and swear that you just got shot by a cannon. You see lights in the distance and panic. It's great! And then the inevitable happens: another ship locks onto yours like a heat-seeking missile, and the chase begins. You try to run, but they're in a Brigantine and you're in a Sloop; neither of you really know how sails work, so you both sort of fumble around until they end up in the wind and suddenly you're getting broadsided. Both you and your crewmate abandon the wheel and run below deck to start repairing - where's the wood?! How do we get all this water out of here?! You're scrambling, panicking. You think you've got it all patched up until there's a massive thud, and even more leaks have sprung at the front of the ship. Your crewmate rushes to get the new leaks patched up, while you head to the deck to see what happened. That's when you see it - the Brigantine! You've accidentally rammed it, and you see two of the Brig's crew furiously swimming around the boat, looking for the ladder and trying to get back aboard. You see there are sharks in the water. The Brig's captain lets go of the helm and drops the anchor, locking the boat in place. You see your chance and take it. You get on the helm of the Sloop, spin the wheel around, and scream at your crewmate to get on the cannons. He does. You start hammering the Brig with everything you've got - cannonballs, firebombs, blunderbombs, something called a chainshot. The Brig springs leaks; there are explosions on the helm, and the deck is on fire; finally, as if in resignation, the masts fall. You sail away. Behind you, against the backdrop of a slowly rising moon, the Brig sinks. It was a great fight, but, sadly, it was also a hypothetical one. Fights like this do happen in Sea of Thieves, but what I've described above is a fight between players who are new and have no idea what they're doing. This is when the PvP in Sea of Thieves is at its absolute best: it's frantic, crazy, and spectacular. More frequently, however, the players deliberately seeking out PvP (and new players) are the people who have already sunk hundreds or thousands of hours into the game, know every modicum of the meta, and who do nothing but fight other players. If, in the above situation, we were talking about a Brig crew who were good at the game and knew the meta, it would have gone more like this: Another ship locks onto yours like a heat-seeking missile, and the chase begins. You try to run, but they're in a Brigantine and you're in a Sloop; they know exactly how sails work and before you know it they're ahead of you. You try to turn away, but your hull explodes, your mast falls, and your crewmate dies. You drop down to the lower deck, confused, and spot another player on your ship. You're not sure how he got there. You pull out your pistol, having never used it before, and fire; by some act of divine providence, you manage to hit the intruder. He jumps off the boat with something that looks a piece of fish in his hand, disappears into the water, and soon he's back on board. You didn't realize until now that someone had dropped your anchor. You attack him with your sword, but it seems like he has fully recovered from your pistol shot. He pulls out a blunderbuss and kills you with a single blast. As your soul leaves your body, you hear the other crew in voice chat, yelling at you. ""Sit down,"" they say. ""Too easy."" After sitting in a green, flaming ship that appears to be sailing through hell for what seems like an eternity, you spawn back on your ship - a new ship, on a different island. The old ship is already sunk. They got your treasure, and your adventure was for nothing. Here's the problem: the latter situation sucks. It's not fun, and, in my experience, it's far more common than the situation I described earlier. This game has an incredibly toxic community which is also very good at the game, and you will run into players who will stop at nothing to not only steal your treasure but also make you feel bad and want to stop playing. The consensus, as far as I can tell, among the more vocal members of the community, is that the game's title contains the word ""Thieves,"" which, upon a quick reference to your favorite dictionary, is evidently defined as ""people who put hundreds of hours into cartoon pirate games for the explicit purpose of trying to make it so other people can't play cartoon pirate games."" The body of water in-game is also called the Sea of Thieves, which must be telling. After all, every body of water inherits properties from its name. Pacific means ""peaceful in character,"" and we all know that no wars have ever been fought in the Pacific Ocean. These experiences will occur, and they may end up being your first encounter with other players. Unlike Rust or ARK, there is no server list in Sea of Thieves; you must play with other, random members of the community (toxic players included), or not play at all. The value proposition, then, is wrong. This is a $40 game with a niche gameplay loop and the express guarantee that you will have many negative experiences with other players. Like I said, I had fun with it; I learned how to avoid other players, and, when combat was inevitable, I learned some of the sneakier tricks. Some people will be so drawn to this game that they'll be willing to do that, but I reckon most people won't. I think that's perfectly reasonable. Buyer beware.",0.874343812465667725

No, I cannot recommend this game if you, like me are a casual player. I get that it is called Sea of Thieves and is a game that heavily pushes PvP. That in itself is not an issue and is a feature of the game - The problem arises, now that most of the casual and friendly player base that used to be in the game has left for greener pastures. I originally played this game when it came out, when it was new and fresh, and everyone was still learning. There were of course people yearning for PvP, it is nothing new, they have always been there. Now, however, they are the only ones left truly playing this game. In practice, this means that now, every time you log in and attempt to get a bit of progress in, running into another ship is an instant death sentence, unless you are incredibly good at the game already. This game does not and will not respect your time. The only way you can enjoy this game, is if you are okay with hours of hard work disappearing in the blink of an eye, because that will happen to you, especially if you are new to the game and still learning. I came back because I heard they had finally caved and made a safer seas mode, only to learn that this mode was completely and utterly useless for me. I don't mind that you only get 30% rewards in safer seas, it makes sense that you get much less reward when there is little to no risk - However, gating reputation levels past level 40 and making you unable to use the ships you have purchased in this game mode is what kills it completely for me. I would have been fine just spending a few hours of my time here and there, slowly chipping away at the reputations with the reduced rewards while sailing on my own ship - But no, I am not allowed to do that, because in order to enjoy this game casually, you are forced to deal with the worst this game has to offer as well. TL:DR: This game is not for people like me, who likes to play the game for a casual adventure with friends. This is a game for hardcore players, ready and willing to dedicate hours of their lives to become true pirate legends and reap the rewards of dunking on much less experienced players. Edit: Hey folks. I've read through your comments and I have a few notes. Yes, I did go back and play a little more after this, pretty much only to do some tall-tales with my friends to at least get a little out of my purchase. I get it, some of you really like this game for what it is, and that's fine. This game is not for me and it's my right not to play it. I wrote this merely to warn other people that this game might not be for them.",0.839678108692169189

However, I am writing this Review as i have hit a brickwall with the Moderators and Rare themselves and more than likely will be Permanently banned soon as they are getting tired of Removing my posts which are calling them out in regards to their recent ""But we banned X"" accounts post. SoT has a lot of potential, It fills that Niche of allowing the user to explore freely while also giving them the choice if they want to do PvE, Fishing, PvP, Ambush Tactics, Alliances, Hunting, Exploring, Questing, Story, Trying to break the game? But something it has always struggled with is Hackers, And ever since they released ""Hourglass"" that problem has only doubled as you need Rank 100 to get the ""Cool Hip New Cosmetics"" forcing players to do PvP which then leads to more people using hacks to succeed in PvP rather than get good at the game as people can get away with Hacking as long as it isn't blatant and as long as it isn't Video Recorded. When you mention Hackers the Forum Mods remove it and label ""Misinformation"" and when you call out that choice they then flag you with ""Baiting staff"" and threaten to Perma ban you. If there wasn't an issue people wouldn't talk about Hackers. If you mention Emporium aswell? They get very angry. Emporium is a whole 'nother issue, When i first started i thought Emporium was great bought a couple skins was enjoying myself . . Until i noticed a pattern. Y'see people get REALLY angry when you have Paid Cosmetics in-game they go out of their way to harass Emporium users. Soon as i removed my Cosmetics the behaviour changed again people aren't as aggressive. Rare is known for putting all their eggs in a single basket y'see, They put everything into Voyages (One time content) and Emporium. Well, Atleast for last two years. Sure, They added Captaincy (Which is garbage) because it gives you zero control over your own damned ship but also doesn't let you modify anything important (Anchor) (Barrels) & (Cannons) Nobody cares about Trinkets or paintings Majority of captained vessels i've seen are all Copy Paste aside from the ""Ship Name"" Then you have Hourglass, Arguably one of the worst things to happen to SoT. Hourglass itself is fine, However the server issues that came alongside it? The forced interaction with PvP to get Cosmetics or Titles? The In-equality of ship supplies in matchmade PvP? The ""MMR SYSTEM"" which is fake and doesn't actually do anything? Not okay. They seem hardstuck trying to push PvP instead of add features people have basically begged for years for. Still no new Big Encounter (Meg / Kraken) Still no new content for storms so no reason to EVER enter one aside from escape fleas who run when you try to fight em but follow when you dont. Still no new region, Volcano is DoA nobody EVER goes in unless voyage forces it. Still no new Enemies, We still have PoTC enemies acting as ""New"" content. No new ships, No meaningful ship customization, Still can't restrict players (On your team) as a captain from using Anchor aside from raising it. No reason to level Hunter Call No reason to EVER use Order Of Souls The Devs think ""Reworking"" Islands count as new content even though i've never seen a single soul explore said ""Reworked"" islands (Fort Merrick) you go to islands to collect and sell loot and then leave just as fast. Majority of their community still hasn't seen the new Cutscene for Flame or Athena cause 100 PvP Ranks is too much. Majority of their community won't do World Events cause they know it's not worth the hassle you clear while watching horizon. Overwhelming Majority won't touch Sunken shrines cause you have to leave ship defenseless to clear the shrine and because of that Ocean Curse is always going to be ultra rare. I've only seen people do FaF / FoF (However you want to spell it) / (Activated World Event with Ritual Skull) Maybe once, Nobody is dumb enough to waste their own time to have the work potentially stolen by every hippie in the server. The Tutorial for the game STILL after ALL OF THESE YEARS does not teach the user Windmanagement which is why so many people exit Tutorial and are so god damned clueless about why the ship isn't moving fast. Hell, The Tutorial doesn't even teach you how to stop the ship an extremely unhealthy amount of people rely on Anchor to do ANYTHING. Majority don't know that Harpoon can grab loot either until people show you it. Zero Tutorial for fishing either, The Quality Of Life features are Awful for new players. Don't have friends? Time to enjoy sifting through Random Queue after Random Queue of people that want to Sabotage or just want to join for payout and leave right after. When you raise concern? Get told ""Use Discord not our problem"" instead of the Devs getting off their arse and making an actual Lobby List instead of ""Randomly Queue and pray"" Captaincy should allow the player to write a ""Custom Message"" for their Ship which appears in ""Lobby List"" and allows the user to choose for themselves if they want to join ""Fishing Boat"" or ""Shrines"" or ""PvP"" or ""Meg Hunters"" or ""Story Enjoyers"" or ""Achievement Hunting"" Zero, And i mean, ZERO Quality of life for users they expect / demand you use Discord to matchmake otherwise enjoy sifting for an hour to get people that wanna play SoT. Complete focus on Cash Shop, In-game stuff from last year and half has been awful aside from PvP Content. And for all the money they're making? They have worse servers than Warcraft 3 Reforged, I don't suggest buying the game in current state. They don't care about hackers unless they cheat the paid currency, They don't care about server security, They don't care about PvE players, They don't care about how bad the servers are running and the rubber banding. Any other game? I have 20ms max, This game? Comfortable 90ms at all times if not higher. I wasn't going to write this review but y'know what? If they want to Silence me on forums, Fine. You can't delete Reviews without paying off Steam, So better get shelving money to Steam if you don't want my Review up can't silence me otherwise. TLDR; Good game, Awful Community, Awful Developers, And Awful Quality Of Life.",0.832413911819458008

For a lot of us Safer Seas was a lifeline for this game. Many of us were holding onto the hope that we could finally enjoy the game but I haven't wanted to play SoT since Safer Seas released. With no real reward for grinding, not being able to use your own ships, not being able to co-op with other friendly pirates and being extremely limited on what you can and cant do ruins any fun aspects that the game had left. I only started playing at the beginning of season 10, I obsessed over this game until Safer Seas released only because I was counting on the fact Safer Seas would be better and more enjoyable gameplay for someone like myself. I can't even bring myself to log into the game anymore as it as tremendously boring. While I enjoyed my time on the high seas, pvp its not something that I want do all the time and I think players should be able to enjoy Sea of Thieves in both peaceful and pvp settings. Almost all other games have some form of PVE or Non-Friendly fire servers. I hope that as Safer Seas ages, changes are made to include the ""peaceful"" community. Original Review: My younger sister has been playing SoT on and off for years now. She finally convinced me to purchase the game a few weeks ago. Since I've played for over 100 hours, reached Pirate Legend and have really enjoyed my voyages on the seas. The game is filled with content and things to do, beautiful places and in depth stories but actually enjoying the story and PVE aspects of SoT is almost impossible. Not knowing the tricks and tips that the well versed community have access too as a new player can make the game seem impossible to play, I was shocked that the servers were not skill or level based match making. Because of this it is somewhat annoying that you cant have private servers or even just PVE servers. While I understand where some of the concerns come from within the 'pro pvp' community of SoT, I do not see how adding a PVE side to the game would hurt SoT. If anything, I think it would make the PVP aspect better by filtering out the players who are sailing to enjoy the lore and don't want to involve themselves in the PVP aspect (which is totally valid and okay). As a new player I really don't think I'd recommend getting this game to others. It is hard to get into without help, especially if many of the players sharing your servers do not respect the ""Pirate Code"", the toxicity that some of these seasoned players show is disheartening and unwelcoming to newcomers. While I have met a handful of fun and nice players over the last few weeks the bad experiences overshadow the good ones. I hope that with Safer Seas being implemented we will see more changes for PVE players and in general a more enjoyable experience for everyone.",0.825568675994873047

This game is AMAZINGLY fun to play with family. I play with my wife and son and this have an absolute blast... UNTIL you run into literally any other of the utterly toxic players. Horrible community simply harasses you until you leave the game. There are very obvious cheating issues happening as my son and I have been DDOS'd while playing. It's ridiculous that ""safer seas"" penalizes you for wishing not to play with the horrible community. But it looks like I'll have to stick with the nerfed ""safer seas"" version to keep my router safe from DDOS attacks and avoid the absolute arseholes who take joy in trolling new players. New PS5 players are going to hate this game because the toxic arsewipes that sweat this game already have plenty of worthless gold, and they're ONLY there to grief you. It's almost not worth playing, even with safer seas, as the game removes captained ships which means you can't sell to Sovereigns at the port, you have to run each piece of loot half a mile to sell it which makes this game tedious beyond imagination. If Rare simply let you have captained ships in Safer Seas mode, I'd absolutely LOVE it.

But please read first, This game is amazing, so immersive, so beautiful, literally feels like the world is alive, but I'm not really a PvP person, if I can, I will avoid it, but I love doing the main quests related to the story, and fight skeletons and bosses, pillage vaults and active forts. There's so much content I love that doesn't relate people. More often than not I just want to farm my fishing rank, by selling it to the emissary in the sea post, and some degenerates in a huge boat will gank me and kill me for 8 bananas in my possession, and then if I display my displeasure towards such unnecessary retaliation, I get insulted and told ""IT's cALleD seA oF THievES, nOt SeA oF cUcks"". Okay man, do you even hug your mother? Do you need some sort of support? You spend your money constantly on boat skins and seasons passes but can't even afford therapy? Bro. Let me fish in peace, I don't want your smoke. Sometimes I'm just focusing on the tales and literally have only 8 bananas in my possession, you bet your runt I will sail into the red sea and make you waste your precious time if you follow me. I would love if this game had a Single Player option, or an option in which I could host to play with my friends, some people just wanna focus on the lore, and fight Mobs and NPC's. You're not any better than me if you play this game 24/7 and constantly pick reaper to torment people that aren't even engaging in battle with you. Let me do my thing, and enjoy the SAME game I bought with my money, the way I see fit. Just like you. That argument that it's called Sea of Thieves and blah blah blah, is dog water. It just shows you use little to no brain and think only your way of thinking is the right one. If you really have this mentality, you're boring. Anyway, that's all. If they do add a SP feature in the future I will change my review. Cheers. Edit: Hey people, thank you for the awards and kind words via DM's. Also, the ""clown"" award givers, I'm glad you decide to give me points even though you disagree with me. <3 I got so many 10k profiles. If I'm a clown, at least I'll be a clown with a fancy profile.

Dive in with this revised edition of the game, which includes access to digital bonus media.",Rare Ltd,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Xbox Game Studios,"After 238 hours worth of playing this game, I have decided to leave a review. This is a beautiful game with novel gameplay features, a fun art style, and a good variety of quests and adventures to go on. This is a game that can be played with friends, but also is good to play with random players, and can even be handled solo pretty well. The grind for cosmetics can be tedious at times, but ultimately is not too bad. The cosmetics are really fun to mix and match with as well. I really love the unique sailing mechanics, and the ability to ""play"" an instrument and sync up with your crew and other crews is one of the best features of the game. With all of the positives of this game said, I am uninstalling the game, and don't think I will be returning anytime soon, if at all. I know I will probably invite harassment from them for saying so, but this game has a problem with toxic PvP players. Recently I have run into a number of crews who have pretended to be friendly only to sink my ship, and then will be horribly mean spirited in chat about it. Even worse, I have been on two crews just today who were the ones pretending to be friendly before killing players that are oftentimes new, over and over, without just sinking their ship. They even got mad at me when I told the new players how to scuttle their ship. They seem to take some kind of sick pleasure in being toxic people and torturing inexperienced players. They always justify their behavior by saying things like ""it's sea of theives, not sea of friends"", ""it's a pirate game"", ""get good"", or ""mad cause bad"", etc. If this is the kind of players that this game seems to attract and retain nowadays, I think I'll just be leaving. I know this long winded review will just be a drop in the bucket of positive reviews. I just hope that Rare eventually addresses this in a meaningful way, like dedicated PvE servers, or an opt-out passive mode like GTA V Online has. Or if not, I hope a game comes along that copies the gameplay mechanics that made this game so uniquely fun, while allowing for the features I just mentioned that Rare refuses to put in.

Dive in with this revised edition of the game, which includes access to digital bonus media.",Rare Ltd,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Xbox Game Studios,"This review will definitely get some salty Sea of Thieves fans fuming, but well idrc. Let's start with the good things: - The game is extremely fun to play with friends, mess around and do dumb stuff together. - The content is very broad and interesting and provides things to do. - The whole system with Trading Companies is engaging and let's you experience the game however you like, though this comes with a massive con I'll talk about later on. - The overall mechanics of exploration are probably the best thing about the game, being able to sail, find hidden treasures, do quests etc. A bunch of other things to be named I am sure, but this review is to focus more on the negative things. Let's look over those: - The game is VERY unfriendly to new players. Especially with newer updates only increasing the rewards for veteran players. Starting out in this game is pretty much a nightmare especially if you want to experience the game authentically without sweating some online guide of how to get rich quick, which half the time won't really work. You'll be earning almost no gold, if you try to earn more gold through trading companies sorry, you're under attack by a max rep Reaper who does nothing but pvp 24/7 by exploiting every single ""strat"" that exists in-game. By the time you get to earning any kind of normal rewards you'll be tired of the game and want to quit. - As I mentioned before in the good part of the game, trading companies are a very nice system that is sadly ruined by Sea of Thieves insistence to reward pvp players and veterans, which really goes hand in hand as most veteran players are usually pvp sweats on Reaper. It's pretty much useless to be an Emissary for any other TC as you'll have to spend insane amounts of time grinding to earn any kind of normal reward, that is if you aren't attacked by a Reaper ship every 5 minutes. So your choices are a) learn some kind of quick and easy way to farm gold, ruining any kind of authentic gameplay experience or b) be forced to become a pvp Reaper sweat, basically ruining the point of Trading Companies since to really reap the true benefits of the system you are forced to only play one type of playstyle. - The community might be one of the worst, most self unaware cesspits to exist on planet Earth. You will rarely find a community this toxic and yet so unapologetic. They will completely ruin the game experience for any new players, tell you to get good as if you even have the chance to do so, praise every update that helps veteran players only and then be BAFFLED and absolutely ASTONISHED that new players who simply did not even have a chance to enjoy the game complain about it and will start blaming them for just not becoming better. A massive excuse is ""It's a pirate game"" ""There is gonna be fighting"", ok, then just remove every other system from the game. What's the point of the TCs, any islands, questlines etc. if it's just a pvp game, might as well leave the outposts only, make the map smaller and just make it a full pvp game. I am convinced half the fanbase just ignore the ""adventure"" and ""open world"" and ""exploration"" tags for the game. It has massive content variety for a reason.",0.78920590877532959

Dive in with this revised edition of the game, which includes access to digital bonus media.",Rare Ltd,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Xbox Game Studios,"Sea of Thieves is overwhelmed with PvP at the moment. If you're planning on buying the game to enjoy its PvE content, you'll soon realize many players have played the game for so long they are only looking for PvP at this point. And they will lead you into a fight no matter what your intent is. They can't take no for an answer, so you will be insulted countless times just because you're here when they are. They will be very creative at making your experience terrible for their own enjoyment, it's pretty rare that they'll just take your loot (if any) then leave without pushing it further for 15+ minutes. Most likely they'll sink your ship and kill you repeatedly, even though it serves no purpose besides wasting your time. The community is toxic beyond belief and their ""debate"" over private servers is yet another proof. The game itself is very immersive, with gorgeous graphics and ambiences, awesome characters & ships design, and most of the PvE content is enjoyable even in solo... It's not too casual yet not too hard, though you'll definitely need a good team to unlock what this game has to offer. Menus are confusing at first but you get used to them pretty quickly. To be honest I'd be 100% recommending this game if the players base was not so despicable. I've not met anyone friendly in 40+ hours of gameplay (and I truly mean NOT ONCE), despite what some people might say. I don't mind PvP every now and then but I despise toxic communities, and this one is the worst I've seen by far, over nearly 25 years of gaming. I cannot recommend this game to new players: mixing PvP and PvE together isn't a terrible idea, but right now people are playing this game as if it was just another team-based competitive FPS, and you can't really enjoy PvE with that many bullies and trolls around... I've given this game a chance (twice), and I still enjoy its content and gameplay very much, yet I uninstalled it again and I'm considering asking for a refund because toxic players can't even understand when they're going too far. I feel like people are asking for private servers mostly to avoid toxic players at this point (not just for roleplay with rewards disabled), and I cannot blame them for asking that much. This shouldn't happen. What a shame for such an amazing game... EDIT: Anyone complaining about toxic PvP players in their review are receiving tons of judgemental comments, which (again) proves how toxic this community is. Just browse through negative reviews (sometimes even positive ones) and see for yourself! Besides trolls and fake reviews this topic is present in almost every single review. The same guys that are bullying players in the game are finding cheap excuses for their toxic behavior in the comments around here. No good will ever come from such community until PvP is somehow restricted, and toxic players are effectively removed. I don't believe this is happening anytime soon, I've watched pro players streaming SoT ever since release and even though they're nearly unbeatable at the game, they're still annoyed by all these toxic behaviors. No online game should ever come to this!",0.787672042846679688

Dive in with this revised edition of the game, which includes access to digital bonus media.",Rare Ltd,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Xbox Game Studios,"TLDR Sea of Thieves can be a blast with friends, but you will likely find yourself getting bored with trying to complete the more challenging things in the game, due to the only reward being cosmetics for your character/ship. This game is really what you make it, and it is very hard to “make” fun without playing with a group of friends. Ultimately, I would not recommend people to buy Sea of Thieves unless you know you will have a group of friends that will commit to playing with you. Otherwise this game may just end up another game of the day within your friend group. If you find yourself on the fence about Sea of Thieves, just bite the bullet and get the game pass (Windows Store) to decide if you will play a game like this long term. In Depth Sea of Thieves is an open world, multiplayer focused, pirate game by Rare. The game recently rereleased for steam; I played the game when it originally released alongside the PC version of the Xbox game pass, so this gives me a chance to see if the game has evolved in any major ways since I last played. It is fantastic to see “Microsoft Studio” games releasing outside the Microsoft store, even if it does seem to be much later than anyone would like. Multiplayer seems to be the focus and draw for a game like Sea of Thieves. The world seems empty and hollow without seeing other players, friendly or otherwise, this discouraged solo play for me. It is sad to see a game like this be hindered by the multiplayer focus; This does just seem to be the byproduct of the games industry constantly pushing out unfinished games with the lure of “our players are the game”. I had a ton of fun while playing with friends, collecting loot from islands, playing sea shanties, fighting a kraken, or just sailing on the open ocean. Sadly, none of this really felt the same while playing by myself. Visually, Sea of Thieves was surprising. The cartoonish aesthetic fits perfectly and I really couldn’t imagine this game without it. The character designs can seem a bit unpolished, but I think this just leans into the rough aspect of living on the open seas. The water physics are phenomenal and work as you would expect them to, no matter what you try. Sailing waves, swimming into a storm, or collecting floating loot, the water physics just work. The major reason I couldn’t find myself getting engrossed is the lack of meaningful player progression. The main thing to work towards is cosmetic items and getting more missions to grind. There are a metric ton of cosmetic items to earn and while that is nice, the only difference from someone who has played the game for 1000 hours and someone like me with 20ish… is visuals. With cosmetics being the only player progression, you may expect there to be no in-game micro transactions, but sadly there are… more cosmetics. -HiPFiRED If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group",0.784501910209655762

I learned more stuff: - Sledgehammer wanted to make Advanced Warfare 2 but guess what, Activision said nope and instead they decided Sledgehammer had to make MW3. - Infinity Ward wanted to make the game their way, not Sledgehammer's way. - The story mode was so bad because Infinity Ward told them what to do. So, either way Soap was going to do. - This game was made under 16 months and every developer had to put many hours into it. Crunch, in other words. - Midway making this game, Activision had to change the direction of the story mode. The story was supposted to happen around Mexico. - Activision said, in the beginning of the game, it might be either a DLC or a game leaving Sledgehammer's developers confused. - Even if it were to be a dlc or a game, they would still charge you 70€ - Now we know that it wasn't Sledgehammer's fault to make Vanguard, Activision decided that they had to make a horrible game. These developers deserve the best and next to Treyarch (having done Cold War), they don't deserve this harrasment. Instead, Activision should stop doing nonsense stuff. On the other hand, this game is a masterpiece given the time and stuff they had to do. It is average but given the time and conditions, arguably a masterpiece on its own.",0.940301120281219482

It's not a bad game as such, but it comes up short. There's plenty of positive things to say about this game: The gameplay and combat is pretty good throughout, more or less emulating 5e D&D combat with some changes. The game is pretty nice looking and the production values are generally high even if the over-the-top high fantasy aesthetics don't appeal to me personally. There's some good performances in the game as well and it's very impressive that the game is fully voiced (other than your PC in dialogue, which I don't count against the game). Overall the game is impressively ambitious. Some of these things are something of a double edged sword though, more on that later. So, while most of my negatives will be very much up to taste, it is undeniable that the game is unfinished. The entire game is janky in every aspect, but the further into the game you go, the rougher it gets. Then it almost completely falls apart toward the end. Performance takes a huge hit, weird glitches and bugs start appearing (both visual and gameplay), quests start breaking, dialogue scenes start breaking, enemies see you through walls, people start conversations with you from a mile away. It's really bad. Your choices end up having very little impact in the end. Especially one persistent, very foreshadowed choice that you choose to do or not do throughout the game, ends up seemingly making no difference at all. Toward the end NPC interactivity drops significantly, wherein almost every NPC becomes an animatronic puppet barking single lines of dialogue, where you cannot interact with them like you would in any other CRPG. It feels like companions stop participating in the story almost altogether, sans their personal questlines. Some of this is present before the final act as well, but toward the end is where it becomes very jarring. This is part of the aforementioned double edged sword for wanting to voice and animate all dialogue in the game. It also feels like they cut an entire area out of the final act, an area for which you can see an entrance but can never access. That is fair I suppose, as they didn't manage to populate even what they had with meaningful content, I wouldn't want to see it spread out even further. But then there's other CRPGs I've loved even though they've had lackluster or unfinished final acts, such as Tyranny. So what are the other problems? I said that the gameplay is pretty good, but it has its own share of problems. In tabletop D&D 5e, the DM should be careful about making their combat scenarios too large, because the system scales pretty poorly and becomes a slog. Same is true here, and Larian was not careful about scaling their combats. There are many mass combats with way too many participants that end up being tedious drudgery. It becomes even more tedious when the game has its characteristic slowdowns where enemies just stand there for 30 seconds before apparently succumbing to analysis paralysis and skipping their turn. This game is so janky. Then when it is your turn, you'll have to contend with some very bad user interface and user experience. Targeting your spells becomes maddening when the AoE indicator keeps wiggling and flickering around. Good luck not hitting your allies. Sometimes the game just kind of freezes for about 5 seconds just to figure out what's going on. Sometimes the game will tell you, you have a 100% chance of hitting... and then you miss 3 times in a row. What? Then there's the jank of party control, or more accurately lack of control. It's fine most of the time, except when you present me with areas with traps and hazards which are triggered by characters stepping on them, and then have my party step on everything without my say-so. Not to speak of when a party member just decides to stop following you for some reason. Where's Shadowheart again? Oh, she's on the other side of the map standing in front of a chest high wall every other companion jumped on top of no problem. This game is SO janky. In general the quality of life and usability features of this game are very lacking. Inventory management and looting especially is a bane for the entire game. I really don't like the camping system. You're just whisked away into a pocket dimension in an instant, a place that is always safe regardless if your camp is in the middle of a dangerous dungeon. No watches, no wandering encounters, no meaningful consideration for resources or safety. This may not be a big deal to many, for me this hurts the immersion of feeling like this is an adventure. For reference, if you want to see this kind of system done right, play Kingmaker. In fact, my general advice is to play Kingmaker instead of this regardless. Then there's the writing, which is what I think truly makes this game unworthy of having the name ""Baldur's Gate"". It manages to be kind of entertainingly cartoony at best, and pretty bad at worst. The companions are a very mixed bag with middling highs and steep lows. So many of them have a kind of a ""coolest guy ever"" syndrome going on, where they have these incredibly over-the-top grandiose backstories. We're level 1 or 2, and my companions are formerly paramours of gods, right hands of an archdevil and the most notorious warlock-batman of the whole region. It's ridiculous, and so lame. There's a couple exceptions, though. Astarion and Shadowheart turned out to be ok as characters. Oh and everyone wants to have sex with you, for some reason? I think Larian imagines that the end goal of any positive human relationship is to have sex. It gets even worse when all sorts of otherwordly being start wanting to bonk you as well. It's embarrassing, and juvenile. The story and writing generally runs the gamut from tropey and shallow, to childishly melodramatic. Plenty of ironic detachment, Marvel-style smug quips, squeecore, and scenes where it feels like you're a receptacle for exposition rather than a character. If you're looking for something with depth, maturity, interesting character dynamics, or complexity you won't find it here. I think pretty early on there was a villain who wanted to kill a kid without a good reason other than she was just that bad? You won't find a character like Jon Irenicus in this game, I'm afraid. Oh and the humor. I was afraid of seeing Larian -style wacky humor, and Larian provided. Comedy is probably more subjective than most other types of writing, but man the sort of 2010s style random internet humor stuff doesn't work for me at all. I'm not pretending that BG 1 or 2 were perfectly written. Both had their quirks and clichés, but it was much more nuanced and complex than this, especially for its time. Another Baldur's Gate games did much better as well was being able to portray a world and place with a reasonable degree of verisimilitude. You felt like a character inhabiting a place in the world. BG3 feels more like walking around a high-fantasy theme park. It seems like Larian really favors having big open maps where everything in the current section in the world is present seamlessly, but it makes plot points like ""None of our scouts can find this place that's next door 5 minute walk away from here"" feel really ridiculous. I feel like this property was given to the wrong hands, or maybe shouldn't have been given to anyone at all. The game is fun, and impressive in many ways. However, Baldur's Gate deserved better than a 'just okay' CRPG with a big budget, low artistic ambitions, and all-encompassing jank.",0.734015524387359619

Heck, I was ready to put it in my top 5 all time favorite games. I have 100+ hours in this game now and just loved the story and choices and the combat. And then Act 3 happened. I started having performance issues, I started having weird glitches were my companions would lose half their bodies and couldn't fight anymore, I've had 5 different quests completely bug out on me and even a main quest bug out that I can't even complete. Not only that, but the story choices of what is going on - the main bad guys and fights aren't as thought out as things were in the first 2 acts. It is very clear that Act 3 was completely rushed in my opinion to get the release out the door and does not have the same care that Acts 1 and 2 had. All of that enjoyment of Acts 1 and 2 to just come up against the frustrations in Act 3 killed my enthusiasm for this game. I know Larian will likely fix these issues as I suspect as more people start finishing the game they will see/hear this criticism - and quite possibly they already know this. But I can't in good faith recommend someone spend 80+ hours in a game and then just run up against game breaking bugs that won't allow them to finish the game they way they want to.

One companion is literally missing a chunk of her questline due to it BEING IN THE UPPER CITY. The game also sort of railroads you into good playthroughs, doing an ""evil"" run will have you loose 3 of your potential 9 companions, two of which don't show up until act 3. There's also no consequences for using illithid powers, despite everyone acting as though there would be. The gameplay itself is good, but the story just falls apart IMO in the last stretch.

In fact there is a lot there to enjoy. I haven't gotten too far but the base combat, the early story, the companions so far all work for me. However the further along I went the MORE and MORE it bothered me that there is no real party/group mechanics for conversations. The whole fact that whoever initiated a conversation (or had one initiated via proximity) is essentially the only character that can do anything and is the one all skill checks are based on just sours the experience in a way that is hard for me personally to move past. I really like using my player character as the face of the party, but having to rely solely on them regardless of circumstance makes me feel compelled to build them certain ways. Having other characters around with useful skills for situation just sit back and do nothing leads to a desire to save scum. It's also just straight up immersion breaking to have characters who should be stepping in for something just sit back completely useless. It's the kind of thing that really generate a dissonance I personally just find grating. I'll probably push through the game on a new character more set up to be the face of the party, I'm sure I'll enjoy it, but I'll still having that grating annoyance with something that I feel like should be a core aspect of a party based crpg. Mostly I want to enjoy the more having fun talking about the different choices and such with friends, if I didn't have friends also playing the game I'd probably feel like I wasted my money not waiting until it's cheaper. This may seem like a pedantic complaint and it probably doesn't affect most people, but it's something that for me personally feels like a core feature missing and bothers me to the point it hampers the experience.",0.671218276023864746

But in a Pen and Paper game I can say to the DM ""I’m jumping over the fires, assume that's what I do if I have to cross one - or I will go around if I can't safely jump over.” The DM might want a Jump check for a long-complicated jump - but as a DM I wouldn't ask a player to roll 15 jump rolls to maneuver around a burning ship. Because It gets boring. But having to maneuver 4 players – one at a time – to jump them over a fire is a lot more boring on a computer screen – because it takes longer than four Players each rolling a dice in a Pen and Paper game and because the other characters follow the leader they can sometimes walk into the flames anyway – unless you separate them and do it even more one at a time. As a DM I also wouldn’t assume that stepping in a flammable liquid would mean that the liquid somehow magically appeared all over the players body and the player would burst into flames for several rounds. Maybe their feet would get covered in some liquid, maybe they would take a tiny amount of fire damage if they weren’t wearing thick leggings of some sort. Maybe they would fall in it if it was grease not oil. But all that depends on how much I would want my players to enjoy their game play and how caught up in the minutia of realism I want to try to be. Mostly I opt for fun. Then there is the actual combat. It’s long and boring to watch each move (plod, plod, plod) then attack one at a time and MISS and MISS and MISS. That’s my main gripe. The time it takes to have each fight. BG and BG2 fights were simple and quick, action and heroism. Part of the problem is the low - non heroic - ability scores. Let me ROLL my character! That way I can get an 18 here and there and expect that my characters will be HEROIC (locking scores at 15 doesn't bode well for my heroes adventuring career in my opinion) – they will run into combat to face their evil foe and have the strength to hammer them, the constitution to take a hit or two and the battle will be over a whole lot quicker. Because they will not miss as much – die as much… and I’m not going to have to try battles twice because I came into a major fight – like the one at the druid grove gates – without having just rested. Rolling characters to me is part of the D&D experience and fun, as is being a little heroic and kicking arse and taking names. Being above average to an heroic level. I don’t mean I couldn’t wipe etc. just that it’s less likely with my buff main character. That's the sort of thing I enjoy. So I think rolling characters is a must and some movement AI improvements so that the non-controlled characters will automatically jump over fire, acid etc. or other obvious hazards as they follow the controlled character. I think the Pen and Paper style combat has a place – the Divinity game proves it’s popular. But the Baldur’s gate combat was always so much more simple and fun. I mean, pick a script for each character. Pause the game and issue orders if the fight is tough enough to need it. Watch the game play itself through the easier fights. Get more done. Explore more. Follow the story more. Handle the big fights by controlling each character if you need to – or the fights where you haven’t been able to rest etc and are low on health and spells. Just my opinion on BG3. I can’t help compare the game to Solasta Crown of the Magister. I’ve played Solasta to the point the early access stops. The combat is more fun. No worry about stepping in fire etc. and all four characters are rolled and so are a bit more heroic and fun, because they have better stats. So no, Miss. Miss, Miss. They still miss – but they do it less often. (maybe the BG3 engine isn't very random or something - I have lost count of critical misses but almost never see a critical hit) I am also assuming the stats of the enemy’s in Solasta are a little lower and the combat balance allows for an slightly easier time of it. Anyway I guess most people will not read this much – maybe the devs will 😊 but thanks for your time if you have. 😊",0.656001806259155273

This was a love/hate experience for me. On the one hand, BG3 was overall very solid and proved that a game could be packed with content and love for the player on release. On the other hand, certain aspects of the game itself just did not work for me (along with some plot holes and performance drop in Act 3). ++ Everything I liked about the game had to do with the ""Larian"" aspects of it. That is, the overall feel, the battles, the storytelling. ++ I loved that initial excitement of creating your character and setting off into the world. Most of that feeling was kept through Act 1. ++ Much of the writing and voice acting was fantastic, especially Karlach. -- Most things I hated about the game involved the D&D implementations. Yes, white knights, I knew it was D&D going into it. I just thought the Original Sin 2 vibe would be enough to keep me happy. -- Rolling dice for EVERYTHING got cumbersome. Combine that with such a high rate of failure in conversations and environment checks, you're forced to save scum every 5 minutes. Otherwise, you'd be completely locked out of certain threads. No, I don't want to replay the entire game just to see what an option did. -- On that vein: In OS2, you either had the option unlocked to Persuade or you didn't depending on your stats. In BG3, having large dice bonuses in Persuasion make you feel like you should have a silk tongue, yet you still fail because of crap rolls and ridiculous difficulty classes, leading to a completely avoidable fight/death of a major NPC. Or, on paper your bonuses suggest you're a master thief. One day you unlock a large gate leading to immense treasure and forgotten secrets, the next you're thwarted by a simple box with an apple in it. These types of instances make you feel less connected to your characters and the world around them. Too inconsistent. -- Resting started to feel like an unnecessary detour after awhile. I got to a point where I was ignoring conversations because I just wanted to finish the game. -- While the combat style was fun, the limitations on skill usage got pretty annoying. This is where I missed the OS2 style where you had action points and could use whatever skills that turn as long as you had the points to use them. -- Having only 12 levels and those thresholds being spaced so far apart, along with some of the levels having very little advancement for your character, took the excitement out of leveling up. That's a huge problem. -- Some of the decisions I made early on just never came to fruition for some reason, almost like an avenue wasn't considered. For example, I accepted Raphael's contract, and just decided to completely ignore it. I never did anything else involving our agreement. At endgame, there was no reference to Raphael or our agreement..nothing, despite it being a binding contract we made. In fact, in the prologue Karlach made reference to the fact that I was saved. How? We failed to complete his contract and never found a way to get out of it. By all rights, Raphael should have taken my soul. This felt like either cut content or something that was never addressed/considered in the first place. -- During the final battle, Zevlor spawned in as an enemy and not an ally. No idea why. I saved him from the Ilithid base even. Played the battle a couple times, always spawned in as an enemy. Made absolutely no sense. -- One thing I will knock Larian for is the way they finish games. The last act always feels less engaging than the previous ones across all their games of this style. The ending itself was just...okay bye. I think they even added a couple epilogue scenes to it post launch, but that didn't seem to help the fact that it just fell flat. I'm sure there is more I'm not thinking of right now. But it seems like this was not a good place to use the D&D rule set in my humble opinion.",0.655314087867736816

Unfortunately, this is still a ""thumbs down"" from me. I'm sure that many people will enjoy it, and Larian is certainly not trying to rip you off or anything, but in MY OPINION, while the art is great and the combat is generally good, the game overall is immature, the world-building is mediocre, and BG 3 is not a worthy successor of Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. So lets break down things a bit: 1. The music. It's phenomenal. Just great. 2. The art/map artwork is outstanding. Some of the maps are just breathtakingly beautiful (Temple of Lathander is my favorite so far). Note, I don't like the ""map design"" so much, where everything is jammed together, but aesthetically they are top notch. 3. The combat is pretty good, with two notable exeptions. 5E is a pretty good combat system and Larian has stayed largely faithful. Their addition of weapon-specfic special attacks works well. Where it really breaks down is shoving. In BG3, shoving is king, and it often breaks the combat. There are three interlocking problems: BG3 makes shoving a bonus action (so you can attack AND shove), it increased the shove distance (from 5 feet to A LOT), and it made big fights very vertical - with lots of ledges and bottomless pits. This introduces a lot of save-or-die Athletics checks (either when you are shoving an enemy or the enemy is shoving you) that just break the system. They're especially prevalent in ""big battles"" - for example, of the six big battles in Act I, 4 have save-or-die shove mechanics, either from bottomless pits, high heights, or pits with monsters. The second major issue is surfaces and grenades, which make armor and concentration spells less valuable. I know Larian loves shoving and surfaces, but it's too much. 4. The potential party members are good in some ways and terrible in others. Honestly, the writing and quips are mostly fine. The ""romances"" seem like they were written by and for teenagers with no idea what real romance actually is (I mean, these NPCs are throwing themselves at me just because I'm not a jerk - it's ... off-putting). By far the worst though are the origins of your companions - they're all super special snowflakes, the ""Coolest Adventurers That Ever Cooled"", who just went down to level one because of the tadpole. They honestly outshine the player character, and that's REALLY BAD. The PC should be the hero of the story, but the other party members are just written to be so much better than you. Larian did this in DOS2 as well and I hated it. It's like playing with a DM who made a bunch of super-cool NPCs that are just better than the players. Very lame. 5. The world building is where this game really fails for me. BG1 and BG2 felt like real, lived-in places, with politics, economies (BG1's whole plot was economic intrigue), and towns where people live. BG3 feels like a series of disconnected set pieces and ""the world"" breaks down as soon as you think about it. ""Worldbuilding"" doesn't mean putting a few books in and referencing place names, but that's the Larian approach. The problem is that there's no deeper thought into making sure things ""make sense"". There are tons of examples of this: from two brothers walking 10 days ""from Baldur's Gate"" to find their sister, to the merchants constantly refreshing their supplies, etc. Honestly, I think this is less Larian and more ""modern D+D"" - which has moved away from ""realistic fantasy worlds"" to ""exciting fantasy fights"". I hate Critical Role, for instance (I find it shallow and splashy - the Michael Bay of fantasy). If you like Critical Role, you'll probably like the ""world"" that BG3 builds for you. Just be aware that it doesn't compare favorably to BG 1+2. This lack of ""consistency/internal realism"" is a big turn-off for me (and if you're about to say ""why are you looking for realism in a game with dragons?"" just realize that this statement isn't the burn you think it is, but rather says a lot about the low-brow fantasy you obviously enjoy). 6. UI/Itemization/inventory management. It's really bad. It's the same system as DOS2 - it was bad then and it's bad now: a clogged action bar (Solasta does the 5E UI just so MUCH better, even if the game is much rougher than BG3 overall), too many magic items/different items to track in inventory, no good way to sort things, and merchants with better items than what you find after epic quests (the only +2 item I saw in Act 1 was in the Zhent merchant at the Goblin Camp. This isn't a key point for me, but yeah, it's certainly bad. 7. They really treated the original voice actor for Minsc poorly by refusing to bring him back to voice the character that HE made so iconic (yes, Jim Cummings wanted to reprise his role). Instead they went with Matt Mercer because Matt is popular and Minsc is popular. By all means, write another character for Matt (I think he's very talented), but writing Jim out of BG3 really reflects poorly on Larian (and honestly on Matt for taking the gig). Anyways, buy it if you like. I'm disappointed in it: given the resources, time (remember, they originally said 2021), and source material they had to work with I feel like it's come up short.",0.639824390411376953

However i have some grief with it. My main problem is its combat system. It feels clunky, stiff and too random. And it is like that, because it is adopted from Dungeons and Dragons (table top pen and paper game) with all it's limitations. I feel like the gaming medium allows for far better systems (developers already made them in previous games). So let me go through, why dnd combat system makes this game frustrating. When you try to attack an enemy you roll your chance to hit against their defence (or they roll their defence against your static attack value if you cast a spell). These rolls modified by different stats of your character and the enemy, but because enemies get stronger as the game progresses, this hit chance is around the same number, let's say 50%. On top of that, the damage you deal is determined by a dice roll (like 1-6, 1-8, 1-10) before modifiers. So it creates a situation, when you try to attack, your damage is determined by a random number among (all 0's are misses) So majority of a time you attack does nothing, or very little. And it would've been fine, if you weren't limited to mostly 1 action per your turn. This means that there is a pretty high probability that your character will make little to nothing impact for multiple times in a row. If you are playing a caster character the combat is even worse. All your strong spells are limited by number of times you can cast them before you rest and replenish them. (Strong spells still can be dodged by enemies, or do minimum damage). This is just like in dnd, but unlike in dnd, in BD3 you have combat encounters every 10 minutes. This means that, as a caster, most of the time, you do just normal attacks because you run out of spell slots (or trying to conserve them). Resting after every combat encounter or two seems pretty impractical, because resting advances time in a game and can fail some quests for you. I know that the idea behind this game was to make a dnd game, and dnd fans would love it. But in my expirience, it's not combat that makes dnd fun, but freeform improvise roleplay players and dm do. And dnd's roleplay isn't possible to adapt to videogame (atleast for now). So in the end, video games that try to stay true to dnd feel off to me. When you try to adapt dnd, you have this amazing roleplay part that you can't adapt to vidiogame and a below average combat system... And for Bd3 roleplay, it's just a branching dialogue tree with skill checks. It's great on it's own, but dnd has so much more. Like half of skills in dnd have aplication in roleplay encounters. And in Bd3 you have these skills, but you don't have a use for them. Like in dnd you have magehand, illusions and others. You have countless ways to use them in dnd, but while playing Bd3, i haven't found a single use for them so far. Didn't have an option in dialogue to use them so far. Maybe you can use ""charm friend"" in dialogue, but haven't tried it. I guess, my whole review can be summarised with sentence ""I wish, i was playing divinity 3 instead of Buldur's gate 3"". Because this game feels like a downgrade from an amazing divinity 2.",0.637890875339508057

It's ambitious, engaging, and enjoyable. It's also torn between two systems, and I fear that Larian will only make this worse as they go along. Larian's character system is taken right out of D&D 5e. This is actually a good thing. 5e has quite a lot going for it, but the biggest thing is the extensive play testing it has received as a combat system. 5e D&D has been around for awhile now, and it does an excellent job of providing robust classes that work in the 5e combat system. Except for Ranger. They botched that one. The problem here is that Larian is not building their encounter system to fit D&D 5e. The Red Cap encounter is an excellent example. A monster who opens an engagement on a character with a 3D10 attack is utterly lethal at the level you'll encounter said monster at. That damage level is usually seen around level 7-9 with serious help, or with a specialized ability. Add to the damage that it can knock your character prone, and you've got a serious balance issue. In this encounter, there are three of them. This isn't the only time Larian tilts the fight heavily out of your favor. In early early release, the enemy would focus fire a character into the grave once they were in the dying state. With a three hit multi-attack in a certain encounter (Which a PC class can't pull off without dual-wield and multi-attack at level 5 or a fighter at 11), you basically watched a character go down, and get executed. Larian also brought back the Divinity cheese that are exploding barrels. Need to wipe out an entire legion of individuals? Throw a barrel at them when they're all standing together. Have your friend stealthed out, and wait for it to land. The tosser may end up in combat, but you're stealthy friend is completely free to move about the world. One fire attack later, and you've got a mob bar-b-que. Note, some targets may not die because they've got a pile of hitpoints appropriate for their level. I don't really take issue with the early access bugs. That's to be expected. They're in the game, and they can screw up your run. You knew that when you bought it as an early access. I take issue with the design philosophy. This is a game trapped between a strong 5e rule set that is the most play tested gaming system on the planet, and the utter madness of the Divinity game mechanics. What made the Divinity system work was the unparalleled flexibility it gave it's player in building synergies. This allowed the player to cope with an ever increasingly complex threat portfolio. You could died pretty often. You might have to completely strip down your character and re-build them, floor up. In one session, your favorite character was a sword slicing, lightning slinging, plated armor warrior. In the next, he was a No-Hecks-Given, watch-the-world-burn Pyromaniacal mage. This is not how 5e operates. Each character has strengths and weaknesses, and player creativity has to be employed to solved the various challenges the game brings. Usually through team work. By adding the kind of mechanics that belonged in Divinity, the game design strains the system of 5e to it's very limits. Larian's solution in Baldur's Gate is to let you face check the newest bastardized concept they've introduced, and mark your death down in their statistics. You're going to die, and it'll come down to a badly designed attack that you didn't know could happen, and had no solution for prior to it's deployment. If you're fine with that, then the game might be for you. I also take issue with some of the characters. Gale, specifically. His back story is ridiculously stupid, considering he's a basic level one wizard. No spoilers here, but how did someone who can't even cast second level spells at your first meeting manage to pull off everything he says he did? Maybe he's lying. Maybe I need to murder him and leave him in a ditch. Probably that one.",0.636850118637084961

Not for a product you want to extract enjoyment out of.

It's not niche and it's not something they don't have a formula for. This should be about tweaking, not starting from the ground up.

This isn't meant to be mean, or to be an attack on the creators of BG3, nor the people that like it. It's my opinion on *the* issue that the game has. I hope it changes, but I acknowledge that it likely won't. I like 5e. I like Divinity Original Sin 2. The systems for each are fun in their own right, but this feels like 5e was pasted onto dos2 and I don't think 5e really works within the framework of a single player video game. At the end of the day the system revokes player agency. Your RP choices don't matter. Your attention to detail don't matter. Your combat plans don't matter. EVERYTHING is down to the roll of dice. Regardless of your capabilities as a player there is *always* a chance at failure. In a tabletop environment, playing with other people this is fine. It adds to the narrative being constructed as you play. You adapt, your fellow players adapt, and the GM adapts as you succeed and fail. This isn't a group tabletop environment. This is a single player video game. It is far from rewarding to pay attention to the game, but be denied options because I failed passive skill checks. It is far from rewarding when I'm am denied role playing choices because I fail skill checks. It is far from rewarding when I use the environment and my party as effectively as possible, but I get critical failure after critical failure. Everything is up to chance, and in the end, there is little to no agency that can truly be found in the game. Now, one might say that the failure adds to your personal story - but again, there is no agency given to the player for those failures. No amount of bonuses can guarantee success and so when you fail something that you built your character for, or have been role playing toward it doesn't feel like you brought the failure onto yourself, but rather the RNG system of the game randomly decided that you failed. What's worse is that random chance can end up deciding your XP gains, and attitude changes from companions. This system of deciding success (both through active and passive rolls) really and truly removes the agency that was felt in DOS2 and the tabletop rpg genre. Everything that makes 5e what it is, including the reliance on chance to decide success and failure requires the tabletop environment to be viable and fun. Even then, GMs can decide to wave dice rolls if they deem the roll unnecessary, ie players taking notes, being attentive, or roleplaying well. You can't do any of that in a video game. And so very core of the game play just doesn't work here in this format. Because of what ultimately feels genuinely unrewarding system that flippantly punishes the player based solely on the results of a random number generator and that there is no human arbitrator actively participating in the results of those rolls I cannot in good conscious recommend this game to anyone. If you want to play a modern, immersive RPG then go play Divinity Original Sin 2. If you want to play a Baldur's Gate game then play BG1 or BG2. If you want the tabletop experience then find an online group. I truly hope that they gut the d20 system out of BG3 before launch, or allow players a choice between the 5e system and that of DOS2. It is upsetting to say as a fan of Larian, Dungeons & Dragons, the genre, and the setting... But I regret buying Baldur's Gate 3, at least for the full price it was at the time.",0.633112490177154541

I'll be comparing them on two of the Baldur's Gate franchises' acclaimed strengths: 1) Ambience (i.e., ""I really liked the music, the environments, and the themes), and 2) Characters (i.e., ""I really liked Minsc and Viconia""). I'll be omitting comparisons regarding story-writing, as the full game has not yet been released. Revisions as content is released. The Short of It Pros: Beautiful visuals, made stronger by the visual diversity of the Forgotten Realms setting. Cons: Lackluster character interactions (i.e., it's hard to care about your companions), and associated negatives. Comments: Bioware made a lot of magical titles because they knew how to get you to care about characters. I won't pose as a social expert, wax poetic or gush nostalgia--Baldur's Gate 3 falls short of my expectations regarding ambience and characters. The Long of It Character Interactions The ignominious irony of Larian's character building is that it's not only hard to care about your companions--their dispositions (Approve/Disapproves), combined with several minor shortcomings, can highlight the game's fairly standard--near cookie-cutter--RPG character design. While this design seemed sufficient for ""Divinity: Original Sin 2"" due to its novel setting and characters, it doesn't seem to fit well here in the context of the Baldur's Gate series and D&D Forgotten Realms setting. An example, avoiding spoilers: The Githyanki fighter you meet right off the bat is heavily driven to achieve one task. She does not like it when you, or others in your party, explore the possibility of other tasks. In dialogue, this means she ""Disapproves"" of your choices, incurring penalty in, presumably, an invisible social currency. While this is common in NPC design, it can highlight the shortcomings of a comically mundane or disjointed side quest, of which there are quite a few. And it's not just that the interactions you have with companions and other NPCs will seem rather one-sided. The most important part of your team... well, the teammates--companions--are particularly selfish. While their simplistic self-centered views are not particularly out of place in 2020 America, sometimes it reaches the point of comedy--nobody really talks about anyone else, unless they disagree. Lastly, there's a distinct lack of basic social elements which any BG2 player would miss, i.e., earning meaningful loyalty from companions, and there's very little feedback as to what I just spent away in social currency. Ambience The first time I stumbled into a fairly well-known region of the Forgotten Realms setting (name withheld to avoid spoilers) in Baldur's Gate 3, I didn't even have the chance to be delighted--I couldn't even recognize it enough to draw the connection. I will admit, most of my knowledge of this region came from ""The Dark Elf Trilogy"" of written material, by R.A. Salvatore. This is not to say the visuals aren't spectacular--what shines to me in particular are the beautifully rendered characters. The music is nothing to write home about; while the music in Baldur's Gate 2 ranged from excellent (the menu music was a personal favorite of mine) to mediocre, the music in Baldur's Gate 3 harmlessly plays, going unnoticed by me for the vast majority of my playtime. My take If you're looking for the settings, themes, and social dynamics of BG2, Larian's take on Forgotten Realms may not deliver.",0.632365107536315918

I can sink ship after ship and hold my own in most battles but the problem comes into play when you are trying to leave the area and fix your ship. Destroyed enemies spawn in a few seconds after getting destroyed with full health and armor, and new enemies will also spawn usually 4+ at a time. I feel like the goal was to allow for there to always be something to shoot at but it becomes too much when just trying to get through the basics.I cant recommend this game at this time, not until you can actually progress without loosing everything and sinking 20+ times just to complete the ""go to the shipwright"" or ""find a builder"" for you base quest lines",0.526801884174346924

If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat. Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously.

I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game. I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrBhbDTGdX0&t=3s&ab_channel=TheMLGStumps and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiFEeQKpDnc&t=335s&ab_channel=TheMLGStumps",0.945110917091369629

I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before... To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that shit is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase. What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it. I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, shit, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES. It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some shit. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday. It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and shit, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game. Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my dogshit stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.",0.919999539852142334

After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it.

Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are constant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best setup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an option, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users. 2. No audio issue: its been so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot for the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone speak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jumps or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons. 3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more. 4. Matchmaking: I feel like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-players or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills - none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies. I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill level skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it. 5. Ranked: Current Ranked System is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and nothing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating. On top the way i see others play ranked completely draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta. 6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked because those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against. 7. Overall quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want this game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing people through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thought id be working hard on to improve myself in. Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, but the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it. I play on a gaming-Laptop from 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. I will change this review if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cashgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard. I want to hear other peoples experience on this game and their recommendations on what could be better. Stay kind and happy holidays! Carni 24/12/2023",0.889041781425476074

Pros: - Excellent Movement. - Satisfying gun play. Huge variety of guns of all types - Shotguns, SMGs, Pistols, Snipers, ARs. And they all are very good. - Map sizes are excellent, not too big and empty and not too small either. Games are quick and no down time in the middle portion. - New legends and weapons added every season. - Maps are changed/updated every season keeping things fresh. - Seasons are 3 months long offering plenty of time to complete battle pass. - Completing a battle pass gives you enough coins to purchase the following season's battle pass (you only need to buy once if you wanted). - Also recently started offering more free rewards with mid season events etc. - You also get lots of free packs, just for playing and levelling your account. Cons: - Easily the worst servers in any of the major Multiplayer games out there ( 20 tick servers ! PUBG has 60 and Valorant has 128 tick servers !) - Almost non-existent anti-cheat. (Some regions are unplayable because there are so many cheaters. Even worse they have barely done anything to fix this issue in years. They literally have one guy manually reviewing clips and banning people ! ) - Cosmetics are overpriced. One legendary Skin for a gun or legend will cost you $18. - In Game audio is very broken, you can have entire teams land on you and not make a sound. Audio seems to be in a queue of some sort. You may be busy fighting one team and as soon as you are done you will notice another team in your face that you did not hear coming. - Communication is terrible from the studio in general. All you hear is ""we are working on it"" etc. - Also unnecessary drama as some of the devs seem to get involved with the community via twitter, resulting in arguments and other nonsense which is not needed, including trolling players via patch notes or tweets. - Updates almost always cause issues for at least a few hours. Game becomes unplayable or you can't even get into a game. - SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) or more accurately EOMM (Engagement Optimised Match Making) : When you log in to play your first game of the day you will be given an easier lobby to make you feel really good at the game. You will get plenty of kills and maybe even win the game. This gives you a good boost and you will keep playing. You will then be matched with harder and harder opponents and you will constantly die. You will also be matched with team mates of much lower skill than yours and much higher skilled enemies. On top of this you will also be matched with pre-made squads while you are playing solo with randoms (this is something they said early on that randoms will not be matched with pre-made teams). Eventually after you have been losing constantly and getting destroyed by better players you will once again be given an easier lobby just to not put you off completely and that you return again to keep playing. This system is designed to keep you playing the game ! There is no sense of fairness in the matchmaking. People are not matched on skill but based on the fact that you might stop playing. This was added or tweaked somewhere in Season 3 and been noticeable since. The devs as you can expect deny its existence (EOMM), while many people including myself have done tests to check this out. The main reason why I can't recommend this game to new players is because I don't see things changing or improving. After waiting patiently for seasons I have realised they are good at stringing you along making false promises while slowly sneaking in more and more greedy tactics to squeeze more money out of you. Of course its optional and you don't have to spend anything but the money invested is not going into improving the user experience. Cheaters are still rampant, servers are held together by spit and chewing gum and each update brings new issues which takes them weeks to fix.

The Good Honestly, the core gameplay of Apex Legends has to be one of the best games out right now. The weapons, the characters, the movement mechanics, everything is deep and enjoyable. If it's all you look at, and when they truly feel balanced, it really is a great game at it's core, but it's potential is just ruined by terrible choices of the dev team. The Bad Horrific match making, there is no such thing as casual play. I can't understand it, what am I even playing? I'm a dad, I play a couple hours a week of video games, I just want to hop on with some buddies and get some kills and have a little fun, NOT ALLOWED! You will play against the sweatiest try-hards imaginable EVERY GAME, no breaks. It's brutal, but not in the fun grinding haha brutal kind of way, more in the draining you of life almost immediately kind of way. If you play regular lobbies, you play against the top 1% multi-thousand kills players, you play ranked, you still play against those same guys! What's the point of either one, I just want to play against players around my skill level, I don't want to just get headshoted back to back by a triple-take from miles away.

Conclusion: STAY AWAY!

The games downfall starts with the S....L....O....W ""content"" dump every three months which, in some cases, isn't even more content, it's just buffs and nerfs with a couple of lazy recolors in the battle pass. This will, without a doubt, go down as one of the best BR's of all time but it could've been even better. The foundation of the game is strong, the movement mechanics, the ttk, the guns are all pretty balanced and fun. There's so many downfalls to the game though. Solo queue is near impossible, I play the same 100 people all day long it seems like, if you're an above average player you can forget having fun, sbmm is gonna throw you against 3 stack preds, content creators and pros ALL DAY LONG. ""gEt BeTtEr"" ""FiNd BetTeR PeOplE tO PlaY WiTh"" those are the common meat riders reaction when you have any complaint at all. EA is either too stupid or too lazy to update or work on their anti-cheat, balancing the game is also something that seems to be almost impossible for EA to do. Controller has dominated the game forever, it's almost like people think nerfing the input would kill the game, it's called balancing, you can keep your aim assist but it's so overpowered a vast majority of your mnk players have moved on. EA also takes MONTHS to balance anything that needs immediately balanced, it took them months and months to nerf Seer and the same goes for Horizon, both were boring meta characters. Back to the cheating issue, the majority of the community in higher mmr lobbies are on some kind of config, you also have REWASD, Cronus, or just outright aim-bot and walls. I had to put I don't recommend this game, I simply can't for new players, this game is not ""new player friendly"" The skill gap in the game has gotten so high that it's not even worth your time learning, I'd suggest Cod, it's a much easier game to pick up and play.",0.858913183212280273

I can't play casual as I get CONSTANT Predators in my match, I can't even have fun with my friends at this point. - ranking: I get punished for playing active, people were capable of being master rank by ratting. I can't. Holy fuck. - hit reg issues: My bullets literally fly through people, shots don't reg, servers haven't been fixed since I don't know, forever? Last season I played seriously was season 7/8 and there are still the SAME issues. - weapon/character balance: who thought the Nemesis is a balanced weapon? How does Respawn think it is balanced after introducing a new season? Why do they think Horizon is in a good state? - maps: I can't. Broken Moon is one big pile of shit, you can't even predict where people COULD or COULD NOT be anymore, everyone has evac towers on top, everyone has 5 times as much mobility now even though it was more than fine enough, why is this a thing? - blatant cheating: how does EAC not detect blatant aim snapping from head to head?

As a huuuuge fan of First Person Melee games, this was going to be a instant full price day one purchase for me, but since this stupid publisher sold their souls for vbuckaroo's children money from papa Swiney, I am getting it now, 1 year later, without bugs, and with two DLCs, cheaper than the base game... Ain't life grand? The game is pretty good, I have played enough of it on Xbox Cloud to know it's good, Dambuster saved it from trash and actually made it worth it. The FLESH system is a darling (Take notes Techland). So, if I like the game, why is the review negative? Because it uses EOS AND Denuvo... hahahah EOS, it FORCES you to install EOS, no warning, no prompt and it does not run without it... If it does not detect EOS it just closes. What a fucking joke. Also! Denuvo hahahaha, good job punishing your paying customers with worse performance, stutters, and required online connection for a Single Player game! 2024 man, gaming is a nightmare...

First of all, this game defined what P2W means, and if you're playing F2P, you will need THOUSANDS of hours just to catch up to some decent ranks. The game right now is in a dying garbage mode, it will live for few years and the developers know it, so that's why they're trying to make as much money possible in a shortest amount of time, which is by releasing new units every 2~ months, sometimes even more often, which would be fine if they're usable, but 85% of them are completely useless. And the worst thing about it, is that it takes them 6 months to buff unit to make it ""good"" and 9 to 12 to actually make it usable in majority of the content. I really can't comprehend that. Balance patches hit every 3 or so months, and no matter how low your expectations are, don't worry, you will none the less be disappointed. The most complained issue everyone has a problem is RNG in PvP content, when you're playing against AI opponent (Arena, Guild Content), unless you make team comps that nuke or cleave the enemy, you're most likely to lose if you're similar in strength, because the RNG simply favours the defenders (AI), and it's blatantly visible, a simple Violent proc could change the tide of the entire match. RNG with summoning units is a wild ride as well, you will either get Nat 5s every other day or will struggle getting one for months, it feels like it's additionally altered, and it doesn't even matter anyway, since you need devilmons to max out skill of your units, which they made a lot more rarer, so your units are most likely waiting few months to be maxed, because you guess it, they're trying to get you to spend money on getting them, which is just disgusting, given then fact that they gave a colossal amount of scrolls, either cuz they were revamping towers or because they altered the percentage of summoning rates ""Accidentally"". The case with me being that the moment I stopped paying for the in-game content, my RNG went downwards by a large margin, almost feeling like the game is trying everything just to get me back to spending money on it again. *UNCONFIRMED* Another issue being with game lowering the difficulty in some content, desperately trying to get as many players possible, is that some other content gets missed out on, and straight up not worth farming, for instance Ancient runes (Sure, many farm them cuz there's no point not to) but the RNG is outright garbage and hasn't been updated since 2018 or so? which just makes no sense, it varies a lot and getting 1 energy per 2 hours (now a bit less) just doesn't really work out for some people. Another instance being is rune crafting system which also hasn't been updated for years. In short, few rewards that you get from farming dungeons is either runes or rune crafting materials (there's few more but it's not relevant for this argument), and it's either former or the latter (not both), and the amount of crafting materials also varies. Now, with that information, it takes 3-7 dungeon drops of crafting materials to craft a SINGLE RUNE, with WAY LOWER QUALITY than which you would get from that same dungeon, the only benefit is to that you get to pick which rune it is (from that set). So in reality there's a 99% chance that you just lost 3-7 runs without an actual reason. I see no actual reason to start playing this game in 2024, but even if you download it regardless then Best of Luck, Summoner.",0.646898508071899414

You know what's smart? Selling mods. That totally worked out fine on the Xbox and Playstation. It also worked out extremely well on PC when they shoved it in for Skyrim. You know what else went well? How well recieved it was for modders who cashed in. The modders got so much respect and had no problems what so ever. You know what especially didn't happen when paid mods were introduced to Skyrim? The ""mod store"" sure as hell didn't get spammed with duplicate mods and random people trying to cash in on other people's work, work that was free prior to paid mods(And which was taken down and transfered as paid mods as soon as paid mods became a thing). You know what else didn't happen? The ""mod store"" also wasn't infested with a bunch of useless waste of time, cash grab, shitty ""mods"" that some twat threw together in five minutes. /sarcasm Seriously, I'm so fed up of the games industry right now. We've got season passes, ""remasters"" of games that are only a year or two old, a bunch of microtransactions not included in season passes(While being sold and released during the season pass' life), we're also seeing the advent of multiple season passes, not just a single season pass per game but upward of three or more season passes for a single game being refreshed every six fucking months. On top of this? We've got lootboxes. Lootboxes upon lootboxes in literally every single game being released these days which ranges from shitty cosmetics which used to be free and unlockable to full on items to make your weapons better(Like the old days of P2W in F2P MMO's). You know how far they've gone now? Lootboxes, paid boosts and ""legendary"" units/items only obtainable through lootboxes, in single player games. Yes. Single player games now have RNG(Basically gambling) lootbox bullshit in them that give progression boosts. Fuck. This. Shit. Now, the absolute worst of it is the fact that what was once free is now paid(Which seems to be a very common trend these days in the €60 ""Triple Ayy"" games industry). This is content that makes Bethesda's games what they should have been on release and adds a bunch of QoL improvements that should have been in the game on release and haven't actually been developed by Bethesda. Bethesda make the worst inventory systems and have done for years now. It's always been up to the community to fix it and make sense of the shitty organisation in inventory across all Bethesda games. Now, with paid mods, you'll be expected to pay €2-€5 for a simple inventory QoL fix. Like, wtf?! You can't justify this crap. Let's also not forget the fact that there's no gaurentees that these mods will be supported in the future. So, say you buy a mod. Your game gets updated. Your mod breaks and the modder who created it doesn't update the mod. Tough shit. You're SOL and just wasted your money and, possibly, your hundreds of hours game save that relied on a mod to work. Congrats, you've just paid some random asshole and Bethesda to fuck you in the ass and take away hundreds of hours of gameplay away from you. And then you have the whole shitbrigade defending this crap and saying ""Oh, but these things won't be paid mods!"" but they will. They absolutely will. Give all this shit time and before you know it your favourite inventory mod or travel mod or whatever the hell you like will shift from free to unsupported unless you pay. Then we've got the precedence of what it sets for future titles where this shit is baked into the game and there will be no way to support mods outside of it, as in Bethesda and other companies will lock down these games so they can not be modded without using their service. I don't need to explain just how much of an impact that will have on PC gaming. Just remember the amount of freedom as PC gamers we will lose when files and sections of games are locked behind some Single Player DRM which only purpose is to stop people from installing mods outside of the built in ""service."" Just remember that everything that was said five-ten years ago about microtransactions came true. Every. Single. Thing. Now every game has microtranscations. Now every MP game has fucking in-game shops to buy skins, weapons, boosts and whatever the hell else. Now every game has a fucking season pass. Now most -- at least -- have locked DLC or ""microtransactions"" gated on release unless you ""pre-order"" or pay extra for this shit. Just as it was with microtransactions and the warnings we had about that shitfest ten years ago it's going to be the exact same with paid mods. If this shit sails, in two to three years time we're going to see DRM for mods(Which is already a thing from the Skyrim paid mods fiasco btw) in every single mod, the mod scene move from being as open and dynamic to allow people to create what they want and enjoy to a more business orientated system which caters to those who make, basically, FotM content. What will happen then? No more breakouts like Battlegrounds, survival genres, nothing because every single modder and their mother will be trying to cash in on flavour of the month bullshit content with not a single bit of original thought between them. This is not good for gaming. This kind of content should never have paywalls blocking entry other than the initial purchase of the base game. If a mod really goes beyond and sets a game aside then it should be up to the developers/publishers of said game to reward the modder, not have others pay for it. This is not good.",0.934561789035797119

Heartaches by the number. Fallout 4 is a title that, in relation to the previous games, took one great step forward technically and mechanically - but twenty enormous leaps backwards in terms of roleplaying, writing, dialogue, and quests. Fo4 effectually forgets everything that fans of the series loved in the originals, New Vegas, and even Bethesda's own Fallout 3; trading that out for an experience more akin to Borderlands than any other mainline Fallout release. I'm not outright saying that Fallout 4 is a terrible game, it's far from it, but it's simply not the game Fallout and RPG fans rightly expected. Fallout 4 starts with an excellently produced opening cinematic explaining the state of the world in the year 2077, and then you are quickly transitioned to a married couple living in Boston, Massachusetts. From here you choose either the husband or the wife to play as, and then customize the look of your character to your liking. After a bit more exposition, you find yourself running with your spouse (your infant in their arms), to a vault as sirens blare that the nuclear apocalypse has finally come. Due to events unspoiled in this review, you emerge 210 years later - the sole survivor of Vault 111 - on a mission to reconnect with your missing child, who is no longer in the vault when you emerge. As exciting as that opening-plot summary may have sounded, any veteran of the Fallout series would be able to quickly identify countless problems with it. Fallout has always been a franchise about creating your own character who finds their own motivations in a devastated world, with seemingly innumerable options. None of that is true in Fallout 4 however, because the character you play as will always be from before the apocalypse, have had a spouse at some point, have a child, be either a military vet (the husband) or a lawyer (the wife), and will swear an oath at the onset of the game to find their child, which should make all other content meaningless until you have. This kills one of the most iconic aspects of the Fallout series; player narrative freedom. It's the basis for why I've not recommended this game, as it's the first domino to fall that proves Fo4 is not a Fallout RPG, which will be explained further. Switching to something more positive; I think Fallout 4 looks superb. The textures and faces are just passable, but the lighting(+godrays), modeling, animation, and artistic design of the Boston ruins are all visually stunning. The game even performs markedly well for a Bethesda title, apart from some FPS drops in the downtown areas. There were several bugs on release, but most of those issues are fixed now. For once, I have no major complaints about the performance of a Fallout game. Another favorable aspect of Fo4, would be the irrefutably improved combat when compared to prior entries in the series. The shooting is now both precise and reactive, and the AI is clever enough to have some self-preservation instincts. Most fights are undertaken while exploring, and as for the exploration, I'd say it's just as good as you'd expect from any Bethesda game. The world is full of interesting places, and most of the best moments in the game are bred through this pairing of combat and exploration. However, there is one caveat to these mechanics. The issue I have with the combat/exploration duo; is the horseshoe design of most of Fallout 4's dungeons. This is to say, the type of design Skyrim had that circled you back around to the main entrance at the end of each interior level. This is an okay design choice within itself, but considering this is Fallout, where the places you explore are meant to be realistic settings, the horseshoe level structure gets repetitive, and by consequence, immersion breaking - early on in the game. Otherwise, the broader world design suffers no such gameplay errors though. The last encouraging thing I have to say about Fo4, is that the power armor, crafting, and settlement systems are all awesome. Power armor is finally given the depiction it deserves, as it's now less of a normal armor type and more of a vehicle that the player drives. The crafting utilizes nearly every miscellaneous item from the game, allowing them to be broken down for components to modify weapons and armor, and to build settlements. The new settlement system is basic, but thematically makes sense in the world of Fallout, as it shows people attempting to rebuild civilization and organize societies for their own well-being. While I don't agree that gameplay gimmicks are where Fallout should target its energy, these systems are well constructed and engrossing, nonetheless. Refocusing on Fallout's main tenants of design, I'll very bluntly state that the player progression is atrocious. The leveling system in Fo4 removed skills from its makeup, and now relies solely on the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system and perks. This is a problem, because the level of diversity you can apply to your character is limited to 70 perks (many of which are boring stat-multipliers), where as you used to have over a dozen skills with values of 1-100, which made for incredible variation in player type, as well as more worthwhile perks. To compound this issue, Fo4 almost never provides different solutions to quests and dilemmas based on the character you've built; making progression pointless in roleplaying terms. Speaking of things in Fallout 4 that are pointless, the choices are too. Well, that isn’t entirely true, some quests do have a final decision you can make on how to resolve a situation, but in essence you can't choose to be anything but a constant quest-sponge. This is partially due to the aforementioned, restrictive progression system, but the actions you can take are so limiting both physically and in conversation, that you can't kill people you don't like because half of all named characters are essential, and you can almost never turn down a quest in dialogue. Player ""choice"" at its finest. Oh, and as for the damned dialogue... Yet another dumbed-down aspect of Fo4 that was once essential to the series, is the dialogue. The crux of this issue is the limitations the system imposes by always artificially mandating 4 response options, even when more or less may be fitting. This makes conversations feel inhuman, in an uncanny-valley way, which bleeds into both the personalities of the characters and the depth of the quests. Characters (other than SOME companions) are never given the justice they deserve because your interactions with them are so narrow, and quests default to almost always being shoot and loot affairs, because the dialogue is not built for intense, thoughtful debates. Every roleplaying element has proven to be a disappointment, and I’ll expose why. Take a moment to consider this fact: there is not a single writer credited for the creation of Fallout 4. The lead designer, Emil Pagliarulo, is the only person whose job description even partially included writing. This illustrates why there is a lack of thought put into the roleplaying, dialogue, choices, and quests; as they require a consistent team of professional writers to construct and ensure each element works in harmony. That's what's at the heart of Fo4's troubles in my eyes; a complete disrespect towards writing in any form, which is what made Fallout what it is today. When it comes down to it, Fallout 4 is a perfectly well designed game on the basis of being just that; a game. What it is decidedly not however, is a Fallout RPG, because to be one of those you have to actually adhere to what made previous Fallout's so great. Those who have not played a Fallout game before will almost certainly enjoy Fo4, but as a long standing fan of the franchise, and as someone whose favorite game series was Fallout, all Fo4 gives me; is heartaches by the number.

It has an exceptional amount of content, and the early sense of exploring the wasteland is thrilling . Unfortunately, it turns out to be a massive letdown. Here are five reasons why. 1) The engine is not up to the task. Its handling of shadows is infamous. On a GTX1080 it suffers significant framerate drops, even with settings turned down. It is also plagued with glitches, such as characters sinking into the floor or the player getting stuck. 2) The UI is poor. Endlessly scrolling through the Misc section of your inventory to find the latest note or disc which you picked up is infuriating. The lack of any sort of indication of the locations of your companions is a glaring omission, especially given how prone they are to lag behind or disappear altogether (I had to use console commands to retrieve Dogmeat at one point). 3) It’s not a good RPG. You are rarely given compelling choices, and most of those are crude binary options. Skillchecks are limited to dialogue, based on RNG and are easily maxed out regardless of your character build due to the levelling system. I never felt like I was playing *my* character. I completed Fallout 2 six times just to try different character builds and choices. Once is enough for this game. 4) The writing is bland and forgettable for the most part. It doesn’t help that I came to this after Shadowrun: Hong Kong – a game with a compelling storyline and deep characters. Nothing about this game made me care about the people, factions or places it depicts. It was hard to choose between factions not because each had strong merits, but because I disliked them all. As the story funnelled me into wiping out person after person, I realised that I didn't care about the named characters any more than the countless faceless enemies who I'd wiped out in the wasteland. It all felt so meaningless. 5) It’s packed full of busywork. Settlement building is utterly pointless and inconsequential; it doesn’t matter if my settlers have no food or beds. Radiant and miscellaneous quests just act as tedious busywork to fill out the playing time. If a fraction of the time spent on this was spent on the UI, the game would be a better experience. And a bonus negative for Australians - as usual, Bethesda have imposed a big price gouge. Make sure to buy it somewhere other than Steam.",0.871824681758880615

The more I played this game the more it left a sour taste in my mouth until I just finally had enough. During this time I also noticed a trend that more negative reviews for this game began to sprout up. The reason for this I believe is Fallout 4 makes a great first impression, but the more you play the more you question yourself, “Do I actually like this game?” The reason I’m leaving a negative review for this game is I genuinely care about this series and want to discuss the direction it’s taking. I have the same complaints that every other negative review has: RPG elements are bland and practically non-existent Lack of choices Bad Story Lack of depth Overuse of Radiant quests Removal of Skills, Traits, and skill check conversations (excluding Charisma) There is much more to complain about and these topics presented have already been covered by countless other reviews. However there is something I’ve noticed that I haven’t yet seen any other reviewer touch on that I would like to mention. I was curious as to why someone would like this game. So I went over to the positive reviews section for Fallout 4. I see a lot of these positive reviews saying how much they enjoyed playing and so on which is totally cool, this game does have a lot of positive qualities. Then there was an over abundance of positive reviews for this game that have the same formula of “Good game but bad Fallout game,” or “Really fun game, but worst Fallout in the series,” and so on. I wouldn’t pay any attention to these kind of reviews if this was just a handful of people, but I see these kind of “fake positive” reviews everywhere on here. Obviously you’re entitled to your own opinion and I’m entitled to my own, but when I see tons of these “positive reviews” that are more like mixed reviews, it makes me worry about future games of this series. When you leave a positive review for this game, you are sending in a message to Bethesda that the changes made to this series are welcomed and accepted by you. I’m making a negative review for this game because I NEVER want there to be another Fallout game like this one and I DON’T welcome the changes made to the series with the introduction of this sequel.. Maybe I’m just crazy, but when I see you leave a positive review even though you thought it was the weakest entry in the series, it makes me think that you’re simply okay with future titles taking the same formula that Fallout 4 took. I’ve seen this same formula of dumbing down occur in the TES series over the years where the newest entry might be prettier, mechanically superior, and bigger. But in exchange, less content, less roleplay elements, and a loss of identity of what made the previous games amazing. I’ve seen this at a gradual rate for the TES series, but for Fallout, it seemed more of a massive crash to the bottom rather than a steady decline like in TES. I’m regarding of course from New Vegas to Fallout 4 (Yes I know NV wasn’t developed by Bethesda, it’s pretty obvious.) RPG and content wise, New Vegas hit the nail on the head, and in my opinion might be considered the best entry in the series. Take the transition from Fallout 1 to Fallout 2 for example. Fallout 1 cemented in a great system of content like skills, perks, traits, a big world to explore for the time, settlements with quests and interesting characters, etc. Then when Fallout 2 came around it kept in these elements that made Fallout 1 so great and added in even more characters, more factions, more settlements, more weapons, more quests, more choices, and overall more to do. Fallout 2 took the content that came from the previous title and added in even more content and more depth as well. THIS IS HOW A SEQUEL IS SUPPOSE TO BE. A sequel should only remove the issues what made the previous entry weak, and for the previous fallout games the issue was always mechanics, combat, and graphics. Here we are, and now we have a Fallout game that finally got the combat and mechanics right, Fallout 4. But instead of Fallout 4 keeping the great content and depth of the previous games, it disregards them, almost insulting the previous entries. The transition from New Vegas to Fallout 4 is NOT an improvement in the series based on the same transition from 1 to 2 at least for the most part. Fallout 4 might be a huge game, but with depth as shallow as a puddle. For all the people who write these mixed positive reviews, ask yourself this question: Would you be happy if the next Fallout game that came out had the same formula of Fallout 4? If your answer to this question is no, then you need to consider the possible consequences that come from giving this game a positive review. If Bethesda sees that this game was well received, then they’ll continue this same kind of dumbing down formula for their future games where the next Fallout might even provide LESS content and depth (if that’s even possible at this point.) It's important to consider that Bethesda doesn't have the time and energy to sit down and read/analyze all your comments and reviews based on what you think and on what you wrote, but they do pay attention to the numbers AKA the ratio between negative and positive reviews. It might be a decent game in your own eyes, but if you truly want the Fallout series to evolve to something better than what we got for Fallout 4, then you can't leave these extremely mixed positive reviews, it kills any chance we have to improved future titles because these reviews don't have the passion needed to convince Bethesda that they screwed up. Then again you might think I’m totally crazy and wrong, but it’s all cool of course. But in conclusion to all you “mixed positive reviewers” on here, remember it’s not a bad thing to want to settle for more.",0.869202315807342529

I am not one to be liberally salted easily, but since Badtheseda has decided to destroy what little faith I have left of the gormless blighters that make up their ""development"" company, I'm just going to throw out all the crap Badtheseda has made its customers put up with: 1. God forsaken game was glitched from the get-go, including at least one save-destroying bug that totalled your game and it took them weeks to address the glitch. 2. Badtheseda, in their eternal wisdom, decided to disable achievements if you mod your game. Yes, you can only be using some ENB filter or graphic enhancement mod, and hey presto, achievements disabled. In hindsight, that was just the tip of the iceberg. 3. Upon the release of the creation kit, Badtheseda thought it would be a great idea to dedicate part of their site for modders to upload their created mods. Poor tech support, stolen content (more on that later) from other sites and simply ridiculous moderation quickly blew that pipe dream to smithereens. 4. You have groups of twits on Badtheseda.net who think its cool and dandy to simply re-upload mods from other sites without permission just for the rudimentary reason of ""Oh dear, console does not have mods so therefore I'm going to pull my breeches up and be a Robin Hood for the console community! Rob from PC and give to console!"". After realizing that there are actually pre-requisites to alter the mods in order for it to be playable on console, the very same group of said twits, instead of admitting to their shenanigans, started accusing modders (whom were mainly PC players) of attempting to brick their damn consoles. Flame wars ensued and I can only imagine Badtheseda moderators just watching with popcorn in hand. 5. There are two great mysteries in this world. The first is how the world came to be, and the second is where Badtheseda get their crap idea(s) from. Once their mod utopia (read: dystopia) crumbled under their ineffectual maintainence, they released the abortion known as Creation Club and expected people to pay to be a member of this premium-dreamium BS where mods uploaded will somehow magically have better content and quality just because Badtheseda is vetting them. Considering the quality control Badthesda has, coupled with the terrible job they have done thus far, I can only think little of what semblance of QC there even is. I can just simply rant on and on about how Badtheseda just blew themselves a new hole time and time again but there are plenty of other reviews out there that does the same and I am just utilizing this opportunity to say that I did support this game and spent ample time into it. However, I can confidently say now that I won't be buying any of their products since this is the corporate philosophy they run by. EDIT (02/06/19): I came late to the entire fiasco surrounding the hole that Badthesda decided to dig for themselves, but if you prefer an amusing, summarised review of the slap-to-the-face known as Fallout 76, I recommend the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjyeCdd-dl8 Thanks, Badthesda, for doing your best to topple the likes of EA for ""Worst gaming company of the year"".

Not saying that you shouldn't TRY the game (it's free so why wouldn't you), but I hope that by the time you reach the point in the game where you feel like you need to swipe your credit card or start feeling the need to keep playing the game even at the cost of neglecting your real life responsibilities, you'll be able to make an educated decision on whether you want to keep p(l)aying or break yourself out of the vicious cycle that is Lost Ark's gameplay loop. TL;DR Lost Ark is a well-polished game with amazing action combat, fun classes, and stunning visuals. However these pros are only meant to draw players in whereby they will fall prey to the dev team's intentionally predatory pay-to-win mechanics, slog through hours of doing the same repetitive tasks on six or more characters every day, get verbally abused or gatekept by a toxic elitist community, or get randomly banned from the game for no reason. This game is not intended for your average Joe who holds a 9-5 day job and only has 2 hours on average to play games every weekday; it is targeted to either single rich people who have no other responsibilities or dependents and can afford to throw truckloads of cash at the game, or single poor people who have no other responsibilities or dependents and can afford to play this game for 16 hours every day. Korean MMOs are notorious for their top tier gameplay, stunning visuals and graphics, punishing amounts of grinding, and pay-to-win mechanics designed on the philosophy that rich people should always dominate poor people in every aspect of life. Lost Ark unfortunately is no exception to this doctrine. As a new player, upon starting the game you will immediately be wowed by the game's fantastic graphics, polished zones, and fun action combat. But don't be fooled; you are the fish that the devs want to catch and the pretty graphics and amazing gameplay is the bait that they use to hook you in. The story of this game is mediocre and is mainly just generic medieval fantasy garbage that you've likely seen in many previous MMOs or other RPG games. The bad guys of the world are even just generically named as ""demons"". After reading through a few lines of story dialogue you will very soon become lost and confused with regards to where the story is going and eventually you'll just end up skipping the majority of the quest dialogue. The early game from level 1-50 mostly consists of you following the main story quest while doing countless numbers of generic ""kill X"" or ""fetch X"" side quests. In between there are dungeons that you will both run through as part of the main story or optionally as part of a side quest. These dungeons are well designed, but unfortunately you won't be able to team up with anyone to run them because the early game is completely devoid of real human players. Your only companions at this point are the hundreds of bot trains that run around each zone with impunity. Reaching level 50 as a new player will likely take anywhere between 8-40 hours of gameplay, depending on whether you're speedrunning through each zone or taking the time to stop and smell the roses. Once you hit level 50 you'll enter what the game refers to as ""Tier 1"" of progression. There are currently three tiers of progression: 1, 2, and 3 (the current highest tier). This is where you will establish your daily routine for the rest of your Lost Ark, which will consist of doing your daily two Chaos dungeon runs, daily two Guardian runs, daily three Una's tasks (which are again either ""kill X"" or ""fetch X"" quests), and weekly three Una's tasks (which are again mostly just ""kill X"" or ""fetch X"" except scaled up). The progression from Tier 1 to Tier 3 has been streamlined since the game release but is still quite a chore to slog through, especially since at this point in the game you are unlikely to have encountered a single human player. Guardian runs are nearly impossible to solo as a new player and will basically be unplayable as there are no human players to run them with. Chaos dungeons are just braindead solo instances where you mash as many buttons as you can to kill as many mobs as possible while picking up loot. You will log in to do your dailies but once your dailies are done, your vertical progression for the day is capped and there is nothing you can do except wait for the next day for your dailies to reset. For the next 50-100 hours you will slog your way from T1 to T2 and T2 to T3 by doing the same repetitive daily routine of chaos dungeons, fetch quests, and kill quests. The whole time you won't meet a single real human player until you reach T3. But T3 is also where the real grind starts. You thought what you were doing up until this point was repetitive and boring? Nope, you're in for the grind of your life. This is also the point at which the predatory pay-to-win mechanics of this game start to show. Upgrading your gear is RNG-based, and as you go higher not only does the chance of succeeding drop significantly lower, but the cost of each upgrade attempt skyrockets to the point that farming your dailies on a single character will not be enough to make any sort of meaningful progress in a reasonable timeframe. You will have two choices at this point: 1) create alt characters and push them to T3 so you can farm more dailies on each character (daily rewards are per character, not per account) to get more materials to upgrade your main character; OR 2) pull out your credit card. Most players will do a combination of both, resulting in them not only spending an unhealthy number of hours playing the game every day but also an ungodly amount of money on the game just to overcome the artificial barriers put up by the devs preventing you from participating in the best content that Lost Ark has to offer, which is the Legion Raids. By the time you progress far enough in the game to meet the minimum requirements to run your first legion raid, you'll find that nobody wants to take you because the majority of players in this game are already far ahead of you and don't have the patience to teach you the raids, which are actually quite challenging and require you to fail a few times so you can practice. After all, the players that still play the game at this point are hardcore gamers who have 20+ alt characters that they need to farm dailies on every day, so every minute that they spend teaching you and not farming their alts is a minute where they are not making gold. The barriers to playing the most fun content in this game are so high that it is impossible for anyone to surmount them unless they play with a large dedicated group of friends or are willing to empty their entire bank account. If you still have not quit the game by now you will most likely be forced to when AGS (the publisher of Lost Ark) permanently bans you for violating their code of conduct. The ban will happen randomly and without warning, your appeal will be automatically denied, and no explanation for the ban will be given. This is because Lost Ark has the worst infestation of bots and RMTers that possibly has ever existed in an MMO up to this point, and AGS is so incompetent that their efforts to lessen the problem have only ended up making things worse. Legitimate and innocent players get banned on a daily basis while blatant RMTers who have been around since the game's launch stream themselves buying out the entire Lost Ark economy in broad daylight and still go unpunished. All of your time, effort, and money invested in the game gone in an instant with no chance to get it back. By all means, try this game out but don't let it hook you in. It's worth a few hours of your time but nothing more.",0.956186473369598389

English,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"Embark on an odyssey for the Lost Ark in a vast, vibrant world: explore new lands, seek out lost treasures, and test yourself in thrilling action combat in this action-packed free-to-play RPG.",Smilegate RPG,Lost Ark,Amazon Games,"I know what you're thinking, ""Dude, you played the game for almost 2000 hours, how can you not recommend the game?!"" Well, that's the funny thing about this game. You don't really realize what you're getting into until you reach the true endgame. I'll try to be brief and precise about the important issues. First off, the game is fundamentally pretty damn fun. The combat is fun and the visuals range from pretty good to gorgeous. There are plenty of systems that are kind of annoying and there's certainly lots of rng and things to grind at in the game, sometimes frustratingly so. But where I really hit a wall and felt my will to continue completely fade away was the endgame upgrade system. This is where most people realize just how pay-to-win the game is. I reached ilvl 1475 on my main with relative ease, all things considered. I was happy about that considering the extremely low success rates. But once you get into raiding and acquire some relic gear, this game becomes very punishing.. but not the good kind of punishing, the kind of punishing where you can almost hear the sound of laughter coming from somewhere. But, it isn't coming from your friends, or other players, no, it's coming from the devs. They're laughing at you. ""Look at this loser"" you hear them say, ""he failed his 60% chance to upgrade his relic quality, and when he got it the second time, it only went up by 2%. HAHAHAHA, what an idiot"". Now I could clarify, but it would take forever. Just know that this is just one of many upgrade systems in the game, and it's very expensive and very depressing. Plus the game wants you to do this for several pieces of gear across all your characters. Having multiple alts is also encouraged to help aid your main with materials and gold. Unless you completely whale this game and spend thousands of real dollars each month, you will struggle without alts. This makes the game quite repetitive after a while too. The last thing I want to talk about is one of the many currencies in the game called Pheons. This straight up made me quit the game entirely. If they removed it, I might consider coming back. I remember saying to myself ""Instead of subjecting myself to this, how about I just don't, quit, and live a happier life?"" So I did.. at least for a while, i'll explain at the end. I don't think the devs realize how much this currency is destroying their player retention... Basically, Pheons are a currency that you need to purchase most things and ALL important things on the player market/auction house. They are VERY expensive to purchase outright in the store, and the devs give out insultingly low amounts on rare occasions. You need a lot of them, You will always need them as the game gets updated. Dealing with this currency made me feel like someone had their hands around my neck, squeezing just hard enough to keep me alive. In conclusion, I didn't like how this game made me feel anymore. Pheons and just thinking about cutting an ability stone make me want to alt-f4. Overall, this game started to feel like I was dredging through an alleyway full of heroine addicts trying to sell me some smack and hang out with them. Fuck that. Admittedly, I still fire it up from time to time to enjoy some combat, but I could never take this game seriously the way it is. Oh, and the game's bot problem is severe and will probably never be fixed. *edit: Just wanted to add some more context to this. At review time, I hadn't played for 3-4 months. I played a little bit more recently to check in on things, try out the new classes, and check out new skins. The economy appears to be getting worse though. Gold and prices on the auction house have more than doubled, Pheon's are still in play, items are becoming more scarce, bots are still everywhere, and island instances are completely dead. I want to play this game, but It's not worth it. As new games and MMO's come out this year, I imagine more people will leave and move on. Thanks for reading.",0.949984133243560791

At the time of writing, I stopped playing the game almost 2 weeks ago. Today I logged in to take a snapshot of my character screen (like a souvenir) then I uninstalled. This is going to be a thumb-down from someone who have spent 2,000 hours in this game... yeah, I’m going to be *that* kind of person for once. Lost Ark is a game that gives you a lot of thing to do but you’re not going to particularly enjoy it. If I have to give an honest opinion about how much I enjoyed Lost Ark in the 2k hours I’ve played, I’d say maybe 20% was fun while 80% was a waste of time. The game WANTS you to waste that time so that you get to the good part. Reminder: I’m writing this for NEW PLAYERS. So, existing players who gonna read this and comment (I won’t disable comment, criticize within reason) just keep in mind that your/our experience from launch and the experience of someone new today is going to be a stark contrast. The story is just your average MMORPG shtick. Very likely you’re going to stop paying attention at the poor English localization half hour in the game and you’ll start mashing your G key (thus the meme you might have seen already). You’re going to press G for the next 12 hours or so if you’re fast and you don’t get too sidetracked. Else you’re looking about 15 hours of G-spamming. The story is not compelling, you get an occasional cool cutscenes which pretty much tells you everything you need to know then you are sent on your way to do the tedious of story question: Go to X, speak with this NPC, spend 1 minute to go to Y, Speak to this NPC, go back to X and speak with that NPC again, rinse and repeat ad-nauseam. You do the above for 12 – 15 hours before you hit “Tier 1 gear” at which point you start shifting in what’s gonna be your daily routine for the rest of your Lost Ark career. The progression from T1 to mid-T3 is going to be brutal for you. It’s a dead zone, YOUR dead zone. There’s only bots wherever you’re going and the content you can do barely has players to help you with. This is literally going to be a phase where you’re going to spend roughly the next 100 hours (realistically it’s going to be closer to 200 hours) to get in a decent spot in T3. “Decent spot” is an always moving target as the game gets new content and the playerbase keeps moving forward. How tedious it’s going to get there all comes down to how merciful (or in touch with the playerbase) the dev is feeling is feeling at that time. As you settle in your daily routine, you’re gonna realize how much RNG is involved in various aspect of the game and how much of it purely waste your time in a way you’re not going to enjoy. Imagine an important item locked behind a collectible that have a low chance to drop three times every week. You might get it on your first try, you might end up getting it on your 20th week (it’s a thing: ask anyone about the “Moake” hell and how group of friends gets their item drop while others are still left behind after 3 months still killing the same boss). Gold is going to be your most valuable currency but the one you farm is going to have trash value. Why? Bots. Oh that Schoolgirl skin you see people walking around in? You can get it in the cash shop for $40 OR you can spend 45,000 gold to purchase it in the auction house. What? You’re only making 3,000k gold week? Well, tough luck! Save for 15 weeks and hope that inflation, caused by the disgusting amount of bot, is not going to make the price rocket to 60k by the time you get your 45k. Oh, you can’t even save that gold because you actually need it to hone your weapon, armor, to purchase mats, to buy dungeon/raid chest, etc, etc. Guess you’re out of luck! Bots are rampant. About 4 months ago, I thought bots were at the worse point (looking at the price of RMT) but oh boy how wrong I was. RMT price is currently half of the price of what I thought was the worse point 4 months ago. What does that mean? The current of the game in terms of botting/RMT is TWICE as worse as the time that I thought it was worse. Inflation is at an all time high. If you still manage to push through all these barriers and somehow manage to get your character high enough for the end-game raid content then congrats! Also; tough luck. No one gonna take you in their raid. The game is such a huge time sink that there’s very few who are willing to spend the time to fail with you in a raid because you WILL fail and you HAVE to fail to learn but the likeliness of having 7 other people who are either happy to teach you or fail with you is so low that you’re going to be spending quite sometime in the party finder just to go nowhere. This game was fun back when it launched. Having a huge group of actual people running beside you in-world was such a breath of fresh air. It was fun, everyone was learning, everyone was talking. The current new player experience is a dead zone that I don’t wish upon anyone. The end-game is brutal once you reach it not because of the content difficulty but mostly due to how you’re going to get filtered out. Everything in between is a huge waste of time aimed at squeezing play hours from the players. ""Lost Ark respect your time."": So we were told, turns out it doesn't. ""Lost Ark is alt friendly."": When the game foundation is built upon having multiple characters, this statement is far from the truth. There's so much things to do to make this game alt friendly but dev outright refuse. One of the biggest offender is materials such as Shards which are character bound. If this was an alt friendly game, Shards would never be bound. Neither Guardian/Destruction/Leapstones would have been bound. Lost Ark doesn't respect your time and is possibly one of the worse case of botting I have ever seen in an online game.",0.947143733501434326

Only because I haven't spent thousands of dollars to over-gear beyond the requirements for raids, so that they become a mindless damage-dumping fight to skip mechanics.

Got perma-banned for ""cheating"", tried to dispute it, they wouldn't tell me the reason and sent an automated email response instead. I have never cheated (I don't even know how?!) or bought gold or anything. I've just been playing everyday, enjoying with my family and my boyfriend. I even recently decided to support the game and put in real money to buy skins. The fact that they took my money and then banned me a couple days later for no reason is enough to turn me off from this game. If anything, THEY are the ones committing fraud, not me... It makes me really sad because I only got to enjoy having my character wear a cute pink swimsuit for a couple of days. :( Also this game is not friendly to new players (hell, I've heard even new players are getting banned for no reason). I have a lot of hours, but I didn't play the first couple of weeks when it was released and I still feel behind. Imagine just starting the game now. The beginner areas are all full of bots and some co-op quests that new players need to do are all devoid of any players. (Gesbroy is the worst), Thanks AGS for robbing me of my money and my happiness. It sucks that they're the publishers because the game itself is really great. The graphics are nice, I generally enjoyed the story line, and was enjoying the horizontal gameplay (mokoko hunting is the most satisfying thing). It's just sad that this is happening to innocent players.

The early and mid game was quite enjoyable, otherwise I wouldn’t have gotten to the insufferable endgame. To keep up to date with the latest content, you have to do dailies on a wide roster of characters. These consume so much of your time, become soul draining and repetitive after enough times. All of that work to hone for a CHANCE of getting your item level to qualify for the newest content. Then there’s gatekeeping where it’s essentially a job interview. Your hard work of grinding dailies every single day to qualify for the raids aren’t enough, because now you have the meet the expectations of other players who expect you to have the perfect gear, have the boss memorized to the core, and make zero mistakes. So you have to do even MORE grinding in order to get the right equipment and engravings, somehow become experienced in the raid but no one will accept you because you’re not experienced, and become a robot that perfectly executes every single mechanic. This game and its community is ruthless to casual and new players, as only the hardcore players are welcomed. The only play style in lost ark is hardcore, playing casually is literally impossible. I already have enough work to do in my life, I don’t need any more. If you want to play a game that is fun, can be casual, and respects your time, don’t play lost ark.

As for new people wanting to try this game: New players will never have the early game experience I had to push me to play as much as I did. You will skip past T1-2 and half the raids/dungeons the game has to offer that I got to learn on par with a group. Once you skip to T3 and current content you will be gatekept by the ones who want to get the raids done as quickly as possible and move on to their next character for the week. Learning parties are far and few between, so you can try to sneak into an experienced run. But if you started now or recently, you will have to swipe to reach the newest endgame content quickly, and you'll still be missing the rng obtained card sets you need and stick out like a sore thumb because of your roster level that experienced lobbies check. There ARE lobbies that will take you anyways but expect to spend some time getting denied first. The PvP scene is pretty much nonexistent and the open world bits are unbalanced, so look elsewhere if that's what you're wanting out of this game. ""But you have over 2k hours"" a lot of that was spent playing the game in a different state than what it currently is, with new raids and content every other month, and building new characters to that new content was relatively cheap and not as time consuming. We are almost caught up to Korea and that pacing of content release is going to slow way down while honing costs and time spent for less gain will continue to go up. The combat is very fun and visually the game looks great. Fleshing out your character's build and seeing it come together is very satisfying, but tripods, engravings, and skill points are one and done pretty early on. Ultimately, your character's growth will become governed solely by honing your item level and nothing else, which doesn't give that same satisfaction as it's exponentially more time consuming and expensive for less and less gain. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Spending about 250k gold to push my main from 1565 to 1580 after months of doing the same dailies was honestly just too disheartening. The people I play with either run 18 raids a week for gold and have a main 6 roster almost or all 1580+ OR they don't play enough and aren't able to run the new 1580 content on their main. They likely won't be there in time for Akkan either. I work Mon-Fri, and for months, I dedicated more than half of each day off, including Friday after work to run rested chaos and rested guardians on my roster, and try to squeeze in raids during the week or after grinding dailies during the weekend. And to do that just to barely scrape by to reach 1580 knowing I will only be able to continue playing new content if I continue to grind even more was a realization that finally hit after spending months of materials and gold on that honing session. I enjoy the game's raids when I can, but not 6 characters a week. For a long while, I ran 10+ characters of chaos and guardians, and established a strong main 6 roster. Then I started to cut back and only run main 6 chaos and guardians that generated the new materials, then with new content only my 4 characters at 1540+ I would run rested daily content on. Despite that, I wouldn't have even had enough gold to push ONLY my main to 1580 if not for playing the fish market and holding onto that gold for months. That itself required brainless hours buying Redflesh fish and Pearls because of the Auction House changes to combat bots. That well is now dry, and I don't have it in me to build it back up, either by doing the same chaos and guardian spam every Fri-Sun or sitting there slowly buying up a small ocean of fish watching something on the side. I will and I won't miss this game. The experience at launch and for a while after was some of the best this game had to offer. Me and all my friends learning new mechanics through tier 1 and 2 dungeons and raids, watching each other hone up, and doing content together. Who can make it to T3 first and start selling those great honor leapstones for 800 gold a pop? The 1340-1370 dead zone was the first time the brakes hit the train, some of us made new alts, some took the time to play something else after no lifing the game since release. Argos comes out and we all prog gate 1 together but then numbers started dropping from our group because of the grind. The rest of us continue on, running Argos 1-3 for weeks till Valtan. Slowly through Vykas, Clown, and Brel NM, some started playing less and for others this game became a second (or first for the students/unemployed) job. I grew my roster during this, through more characters to run chaos, occasional swiping, and changing from gunslinger to reaper main I had several strong characters that could run the newest content or at least the first few gates of it. The honing past 1540 is where I finally started to feel the pain of honing draining my resources. My reaper was 1520 on Brel NM release, some other alts were 1500 or working up to it. Same for Brel HM release. My reaper was 1560 and fewer alts were 1540 ready for at least gates 1-2. And yet, I never cleared or even got to attempt gates 5-6 HM because for those who this game became a second job attempted it (and they've still yet to even clear it) without me and the ones I really wanted to try it with. So the ones left behind just stopped playing pretty much because they don't wanna pug it, and understandably so. I usually ran Brel HM 1-2 on 4 characters and 3-4 on 2 of those 4. Now Kayangel is here and my only character I used up the last of my resources to reach 1580. The rest of my roster will never reach that, and realizing so I don't wanna put in the time to even try. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",0.925776243209838867

Unlike a normal job where the employer pays you, Lost Ark gives you every opportunity to pay them instead. Excited yet? You'll be expected to donate thousands of dollars AND hours of your life to this new job! Wait, there's more! If you don't, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content. That's right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you'll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you've never before dreamt of! Don't wait, apply today! Snarky sarcasm aside... This is a pay to win game. That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can. They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that. However, even if you pay you'll find it's never enough, unless you've spent thousands. I'm serious, it's beyond insanity. I have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you: it's just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content. You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren't over-geared for it, other players will express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up. It's a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine. The only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players. All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression. Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you'll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character. Which means you'll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too. The grind-god is never satisfied. You'll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold. What is gold good for? The Auction House. Upgrade items and gear. Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals. That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons. What the heck are Pheons? They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters. The gear you wear is what determines your item level. After you obtain the gear, the chance you'll have to upgrade it will be very low - at the highest levels, less than 1% chance per upgrade attempt, with each attempt costing tens of thousands of gold in materials. Your item level is what determines what raids and other content you can participate in. So, Pheons and Blue Crystals are essentially a pay-to-win currency that severely stifles free-to-play progression. How do you get Pheons? You have to buy them from the in-game marketplace with blue crystals. How do you get blue crystals? By spending real cash, or sacrificing massive amounts of the gold you made that week to exchange said gold for blue crystals, just to exchange the crystals for pheons. Every time you exchange one currency for another, the game taxes you through horrible conversion rates or artificially inflated pricing directly for cash. Of course, many players elect to bypass months of grinding altogether by going to 3rd party gold sellers, who operate swarms of bots on every server. These bots have one goal - farm gold. Unfortunately, this has ruined the economy for anyone who doesn't buy gold, and unforgivably, SmileGate / Amazon have been doing the bare minimum necessary to counter the issue. It really seems to me they have zero ability to control their own in-game economy, and if you aren't a long-time player of MMOs/RPGs let me just say that this is A MAJOR red flag. Buying a solid piece of equipment from the auction house will often cost around 100 gold (which is nothing) but it will cost you 25+ pheons, which is worth about $10 USD. You see the problem yet? Even if you had millions of gold, it's not the gold that is worth anything - it's their cash shop pheon and blue crystal currencies that hold real value. Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK, that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups. Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game. Which is another point of contention - worthless currencies. There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum. Maybe as many as 60? I'm not sure anyone has counted all of the tokens, coins, and other crap you need to collect to spend at vendors, but it's just stupid. Almost all of them are unnecessary. There are so many negatives about this game, such as the card collection system, the tedious and monotonous ""I'd rather watch paint dry"" progression quests and the hellish time-sink of performing those 6 different times on alt characters, the toxic community that gate-keeps every raid or event you'll try to participate in, and so much more.

This game leaves a bitter taste in my mouth to me now, but there was a time where it was sweet and lovely. I wish my feelings for the game had remained strong, but that's not the world we live in, not the world I live in. The bots are demolishing the economy, the content is unnecessarily grindy, Amazon cares little about communicating with their playerbase, and Smilegate has put every region except Korea on the back-burner. I want to keep playing this game. I want to go back to the days where I was the guild master trying my absolute hardest to support my many guild mates, who I had been together with since Tier 1, when times were simpler. I want the feeling of burnout to stop, but I am sure it never will, even if its been half a year since I played the game religiously. Amazon will never admit that bots will never be removed and that the problem will only get worse. They'll never acknowledge that the alt grind is too much for the average player. They won't explain the reasons why they run things the way they do. This isn't the game that I signed up for. What do I mean by this game not being the game that I signed up for? In Korea, Lost Ark leveled the MMO scene and demolished the competition. There was a mass exodus of players from every major MMO to Lost Ark. Players were tired of games where the developers didn't communicate with its players, had horrendous grindfests, and had severe content droughts. Lost Ark turned into the very thing that MMO lovers had wanted to run away from, and it seems like there's no hope in the future as well. How did this happen? I just want to know personally because it hurts not knowing what went wrong. Legendary director Gold River leaving may have played a part in it. Or the unsolvable bot problem. Maybe Amazon deserves all of the blame? I don't know. All I know is that this is not the game that I downloaded on February 11, 2022, and I don't think it ever will be. I want to call for some sort of action, some changes, but I already gave up on that a long time ago, nothing is going to change and I accept that. I accept that the game has problems that will never be resolved. It hurts, but I accept it. I love Lost Ark because of what it meant to me. Ultimately, I will love it no matter what path it goes down. I left the game not with a bang, but a whimper, and that's just how it's going to be.",0.91843944787979126

Get ready to lead 100+ playable characters through a war-torn world only you can save.,Rabbit & Bear Studios,Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes,505 Games ,"I really want to like Eiyuden Chronicle and recommend it, because on the surface this is a Suikoden sequel in all but name. But also its 2024, where is the Suikoden vibes, gameplay mechanics, and pacing, but with QoL features and a better UI than what we got? So much of this game is confusing, even coming from a background of having played Suikoden 1 - 4. So many things also don't work, Eiyuden is really buggy and broken. For example, the cooking contests; you can only win them with two different recipes and that's it, use anything else and the judges will rate your meals a 0/10. The PC version has a broken frame rate that is tied to your encounter rate, so if you play above 60fps, you'll just never get a random enemy encounter. There is also a bug that will prevent you from getting a recruit as well which can lock you out of getting some endings. Then there is the god awful english localization, and how bored the english voice actors all sound when delivering their lines. The combat animations are great at least! The combat is a joy to watch, and R&B Studios really nailed this aspect of the game. Its the one thing that took what looked and worked great with Suikoden and improved upon it, even if everything else is outdated. Balance though can feel completely out of whack, and some mechanics are pointless or make no sense. There is front and back lines for your characters. Some characters cant fight or do certain attacks if they are behind the other characters in your party. This is fine on paper! But the game never tells you about this, you just have to experiment and hope you get it right, and then remember who can be placed where. There is no saving anywhere you want. Come on now, this is a gigantic RPG releasing in 2024, there is no excuse for this. Especially since you'll have long stretches of story followed by multiple combat encounters, and you won't be able to save. In one instance the Inn was right there, but an NPC prevented me from going over to it to save. I had to just continue on and hope for the best, when all I really wanted to do at that point was take a break from playing. The rest of the game though just feels lifeless and devoid of any personality. Pacing can be really bad and a huge chore. You will be backtracking a lot because new recruits become available to find in previous locations as you advance through the story. And you have to be careful with this because some of them could become unavailable later on. So you're kinda forced to do all of this backtracking. Inventory space is also very limited, and items can only stack a few times. Like healing herbs can be in stacks of 6 only, and then take up another inventory slot. Later on you get expanded inventory though, but its still a huge inconvenience for no reason until you get there. Why even have limited inventory space to begin with if you're going to just arbitrarily expand it later on anyways? I really want to recommend this game a lot, but its held back, and is missing so many Quality of Life features, and has a lot of outdated design, that it's a really tough game to enjoy. I love Suikoden, but I was hoping we would be getting that experience in something a bit more modern, not to mention vastly more polished then what we got.",0.798400938510894775

Get ready to lead 100+ playable characters through a war-torn world only you can save.,Rabbit & Bear Studios,Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes,505 Games ,"I played Suikoden II back when this game was announced, as I'd heard a lot of great things about it, so I was definitely curious. In anticipation of this game, I have also played the spin-off Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising, which was pretty mind-numbing, and something I pushed myself through as quickly as possible. I'm not a backer, but I have been an interested lurker throughout the games' development. I apologize in advance for a pretty negative review. In general, I'm actually mid to positive on the game (unfortunately Steam doesn't allow a neutral review), but there's definitely a feeling of a death by a thousand cuts here. Lots of little annoyances and frustrations add up, which has led to my current outlook. I don't hate it, I just wish it lived up to my expectations more. I wanted an enhanced, modernized, and improved Suikoden experience. Instead, I just got a Suikoden experience. That might be exactly what some people want, but it's not what I wanted. At times, the game is great, but most of the time, it's very mid. I can't recommend it at full price unless you've specifically played similar titles and want more (quite literally, more of the same). If that isn't you, then I'd really recommend waiting for a sale. The Bad: This is a list of things that are needed to improve the game: - Better English translation (sometimes it's not even close to the Japanese dub and left me wondering if the translation team would have preferred to be the writing team with the liberties they're taking) - Graphically, the sprites are great, but don't fit in the 3D world whatsoever. In general, the 3D world has very minimal detail and is very sparse at best. It's just not fantastical whatsoever. There's a moment where you cross over a rope bridge between two canyons and I sat back expecting a wide camera shot to show off the environment and... nothing. Blurry blobs in the background that are rough mountains. No vista, no nothing. During set pieces there is an artistic vision, but that vision is not shared with the other 99% of the experience - Monsters/bosses are not pixel sprites and lead to this weird clashing of art styles. I don't inherently prefer sprites to 3D, but please just pick one as the art director and stick with it, then everything would just gel better. I am a huge fan of the Octopath Traveller series, though, so perhaps I'm spoiled in that sense (Team Asano are incredible) - The quasi open-world elements are empty and tedious to run through - There is no sprint button, you have to dungeon delve for an equippable item that boosts run speed. Why? There's a button for walking, though... - Battles need to move faster. For random encounters, it's largely a one hit-KO deal, but you'll be there for close to a minute regardless - Button inputs need to be accepted faster (menu scrolling is a delayed nightmare, as is spamming 'attack' in battle) - No main character avatars are present during the 'war' battles, instead replaced with generic character models that come from the early 2000s (it almost looks like I'm playing The Settlers 2 HD). At times, you will see a speech bubble from a recruited hero, but it's just so basic that it leaves you frustrated that there isn't more - The war battles are slow, need a fast-forward option, and really aren't that fun whatsoever. They were interesting in Suikoden II, and I was expecting more, and I wanted a true evolution because it's a really cool mechanic! Unfortunately, they were just underwhelming to the point of almost being embarrassing. They could be removed entirely, and we won't have lost anything (perhaps we would have gained elsewhere as a result) - The menu buttons are inconsistent. Sometimes, you can press the back button, and it'll exit a prompt, other times you won't be allowed to do that and have to press a specific button instead - Pacing. There are times when I'm having lots of fun and then the game will jackknife into hours long sections that are incredibly slow and dull. After the initial HQ you have three routes to explore, all of which have an NPC 1/5th of the way in saying you can't progress any further. Why??? What's the point in having an open-world if I can't go off and explore? - Some heroes are incredibly annoying, but you'll be stuck with them for several hours because you need them to fill a specific role - It's not always clear what range a character has, or why. So you'll often blindly experiment, hoping for the best. I don't see why we can't change formation mid-battle either - Healers are effectively pointless. With such large MP costs for healing, you feel like you need to horde MP for boss battles - but then when you do, you'll quickly find that after 2-3 casts you're spent. Not to mention, there's really no use for offensive magic. Well, back to spamming items then... - Except that you have an inventory limit. Because you have such limited healing ability, you'll find that even with maxed healing items you'll be running on fumes by the end of a dungeon, limping your way through. It's just as well the random encounters are weirdly timed - Character designs are voices are incredibly mismatched at times, it's actually kind of impressive how wide this gap can be - Scripted sections will occasionally have you follow this pattern: talk > awkwardly run > battle > talk > player manually runs > talk > battle > repeat 4-5 times. I appreciate it's to give me time to heal, but it breaks the tension immediately, and really just serves to highlight that they know healing is a gameplay issue and as such, solve it by giving you a break after every scripted encounter - Occasionally you'll get weird audio artefacts. One character voice will be far louder than another, then another will suddenly have way more bass than their previous line. Or you'll get the music not fading out correctly when moving between one area to another - Character speeds are often far lower than enemies. This means that you might get one attack off before they hit you. Except that enemies often attack in rows or columns, so one random encounter can brutally punish you just for existing The Good: Okay, that was a lot of bad. Here's some good: - The music is mostly great, the big scenes hit well, and the dungeon themes are surprisingly dynamic and interesting - Boss battles are mostly interesting, though do suffer a bit from being damage sponges. There are 'gimmicks' (what an awful, awful naming convention by the way, why aren't they called tactics?) that are boss-specific environmental systems/attacks. They can at times be a chance-based system too, which gets annoying, but overall if the pace was quickened they'd be great - The battle system in general is great. The camera (when it works) is really dynamic and gives it a sense of fluidity. I'm hoping it gets more tactical/strategic later on with more character combinations and abilities - The story is quite interesting so far. When the writing is good, it's great",0.789509356021881104

I think we can all agree that this set Suikoden out from its competitors.. it was a MATURE story. 2) The localisation is HORRENDOUS... they have changed nearly every line and made it worst! the dialogue is straight up cringe and its impacts the personalities of the characters making very unlikable.

Yetee Productions handled the Kickstarter rewards distribution. That decision has resulted in a massive mismanagement ranging from people getting the game days and even weeks after launch to nearly all of the extras people paid for not even having a date for when they will receive them. Switch physical users had to be sent digital codes because they have no idea when their physical copies will actually be sent. Steam physical backers got a slip of paper in a box with a code.

I am speaking as someone who has at least O-Level Japanese comprehension and has compared 30 minutes scripts between Chinese , English and Japanese . The English translation is simply not up to the standard. The translation is handled by team with background of DEI activist , likely undergraduate and hired based on sexual orientation . Not only the translation is handled very poorly , with little accuracy and not following the original material , it is downright disrespectful to the original writers . Hence , there is a 7 pages of "" translation code of ethics "" handbook held within the translation team , as discovered by some avid Suikoden Fans . The handbook clearly stated that you must DELIBERATELY insert gender politics , LGBT and racial influence in the game , despite the original game did not mention any of it . According to the handbook , it is ... for the greater goods of the "" modern western audience "" . An eg of how this translates into the game : During a post boss battle scene , a char was talking about how impressive the boss fight was (in both Chinese and Japanese translation ). But in the English translation , it was completely changed into a char questioning the Gender Identity of the boss. How absurd and rude is this to its original writer and dev from Japan ?! This is not just a botched job , it is a textbook example of modern extremist shoving politics down at gamers throat . It is an indoctrination , a corruption of creativity , an exploit of gamers enthusiasm. If you are half of the gamer you think you are , avoid this like a plague . I have already put in more than 2 hours , so I can't refund this . But you can make a difference today , stop buying games like this , stop supporting game translators that has no respect for the source material . As someone who has played the original Suikoden 1 , 2 , 3 , ( Nanami plot twist was so memorable I still remember the game fondly ) , it pains me to write this review but it has to be done. P/S : On top of translation issue , the game is currently littered with a Game breaking bug , where if you have a very high refresh rate monitor your encounter rate would drop so significantly to the point you would not encounter any fights ( hence stop gaining lvls from exp ) on a 240hz refresh rate monitors . As of the time of writing this bug is yet to be fixed .",0.543381690979003906

And from what I did play of this game, it truly felt like a successor to the old games. With the familiar battle system, rune system, recruiting new members etc. A lot of the old ingredients that made the Suikoden stand out from the many JRPG games are there, and i have enjoyed the game so far on that level. But my problem with the game as it is right now, is the English translation. I personally prefer Japanese voice and English subtitles over an English Dub in games, and normally that have been working just fine for me. But in this game the translations deviates too much from the original Japanese lines, to the point where it is too obvious to ignore. The vibes a character gives and what is written in their text-box is often a clear miss match. I understand that localization is more then just 1 to 1 translation, and they have to adapt. But here it is too far off from the original to be called a good, or even a decent localization. It's a shame they gave the job to translators that don't respect the original work, and I truly believe there is a good game in there. But it's hard to enjoy a story rich game, when the story is tainted by a bad translation.",0.593935966491699219

Get ready to lead 100+ playable characters through a war-torn world only you can save.,Rabbit & Bear Studios,Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes,505 Games ,"Poor Translation and a Glacial Pace Eiyuden Chronicles has two major problems that existed in the backer beta and do not seem to have been fixed so far. The first is the very poor translation; not only are there some questionable localization changes which alter the personality of some of the characters and inject modern day lingo into a non-modern setting, but I've noticed quite a few grammatical and spelling errors as well as some nonsensical dialogue lines from town NPCs (""You're not on my level yet."" from an NPC I've never spoken to, with no context given as to why they're making such a comment) and un-capitalized names on some animal npcs. I assume those are backer rewards or something (pay x and get your pet in game), and maybe the backers told them to include the name in lowercase, but proper nouns are capitalized in English, so this is an error. These errors are notably present in the party chat and the NPC discussions, but is usually not seen during quests, mostly because it's nearly all voiced dialogue in quests. The second major problem I've noticed is the pace of combat and the menus. In regards to combat, attack animations take far too long for a game where you have 6 party members on screen. There's a neat thing they do (which Suikoden did too) where if every character and enemy are only using basic attacks, some of the characters will strike at the same time, but I feel like this should have been the standard for every action. I don't care how much work was put into an attack animation when I have to wait 10 seconds for said animation to finish. An easy solution to this is to have an option to speed up skill and spell animations, where a shorter animation plays after seeing it for the first time, with a toggle in combat for this option. The menus are also weirdly slow, with a long fade out and fade in when you go from menu to menu, and a delay after you select something. It makes navigating through the menus a chore, especially since it could have taken a fraction of a second to slide between menu screens, but instead it feels like a labor to go from the backpack menu to the party formation menu. These problems are very amateur issues that should have been ironed out early, and shows a lack of care for the presentation of the product.",0.516458570957183838

The bad translation that seems riding on political view about gender and didnt really capture the original intended word. While playing and reading story i feel a bit disconnected because of the translation. 2. The plot are overall too lighearted and the pacing are to fast or to slow for build up. Some scene that could be epic didn't happen, because of some game mechanic like war simulation. Its a spoiler so i will not specify. 3. The minigame that seems redundant and only put just to increase playtime. I think its not worth it, especially the beyblade kind of thing and yugioh? 4. Lastly, the bug.... One heroes cannot be recruited because of the bug, and it adds to my disappointment. The good point: 1. Arts is awesome, that i wish they could remake suikoden 2 like this. 2. They hired a good voice actor. 3. While its more like parody, i feel like playing a downgraded version of suikoden series which i have not played for so long 4. It's playable on steamdeck which is great, more game should do this. This is my first review, and english not may parent language. Im sorry, just had to put the review out, because its like i'm personally disappointed of the game that marketed using something like ""THIS IS THE SUCCESSOR OF THE SUIKODEN SERIES"" Nope, will never buy the sequel if there is any. Because they screw it even when they have the late suikoden creator helping them. You should buy the game, but don't expect it better than 2, or even 4 which is the worst in my opinion",0.523687362670898438

English,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"From Moon Studios, the award-winning developers of Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps comes No Rest for the Wicked, a visceral, precision Action RPG set to reinvent the genre.",Moon Studios GmbH,No Rest for the Wicked,Private Division,"Had a little fun in the tutorial area, but I'm going to give it some time off now. This is a gem in the making so I'm not going to refund it, just wait for stuff to get fixed and update my review accordingly. Here is what I like and didn't like about the game. The Good: 1. The game is beautiful. I love the art style and the painted look of the game. It's highly stylized, but dark. Reminds me of the art direction of Dishonored. The look is consistent and professional. The game looks like it costs more than it does. 2. Moving and hitting stuff is satisfying and feels right. I'm not taking this for granted. I've refunded games after 5 minutes of gameplay in the past for general unpolished clunkiness. This isn't it. 3. This is a unique game. You never played something like this before, so don't buy this if you expect Diablo mixed with Dark Souls. Yes, it combines mechanics from similar games, but the end result is completely different. It won't shower you with loot. The itemization is meticulous and purposeful. There is some randomization, but only in the correct places. Combat utilizes space differently than Souls games, because of the camera angle. This game prides itself on doing things differently. I appreciate that. 4. It's rich in customization. Items are random, therefore, you need to make decisions on the fly. You can look up a build online, but if you find a really cool item for something else, that won't help you much. It encourages learning the game and staying in the moment, instead of going straight to some wiki. I love that. 5. A cinematic experience. I'm very much intrigued by the story and the characters right from the start. Everything is voice acted and the characters have personalities. I really hope the game gets to a stable state so I wont have to watch everything online. The Bad: 1. Resource collecting?. Some mechanics have no place in this game to the point I wonder how they even got there. Maybe I haven't advanced in the game enough for them to become interesting, but resource collecting just isn't fun. This isn't Minecraft or Rust. I would much rather collect stuff by doing the main thing (fighting) and not waste time hacking a tree or smashing some rocks. 2. Penalties. I'm okay with death penalties, as long as they're fitting. Durability loss on death makes sense in Diablo, not in a game where you die 50 times to a boss to learn it's attack patterns. It's been mentioned a lot, but I can't stress this enough. It's not about how much of it you lose. It's about why you lose it in the first place. It doesn't add anything, just bothersome. 3. The active item wheel / cross from Dark Souls doesn't work here, the game is too fast for that. I would rather have one of those item wheels that pause the game (or not pause it) and allow me to pick any item on the fly. The way it is implemented now is very cumbersome because there are many items to pick from and a lot of them are highly situational moment to moment. So committing to one or two at a time eliminates the strategy of using the right item at the right time. Like I said, this is a unique game, so a new control system is required. 4. It tries too hard to be a platformer when the game isn't designed around that idea. You can't actively jump in this game and you use the same buttom to leap from a ledge, climb, dodge, sprint... That's all fine by me, until the game punishes me for falling off stuff. Then it becomes a problem. Makes you feel like the game tries to catch too much instead of sticking to what makes it good. The Ugly: 1. Performance Issues. The game has no place being this heavy, especially with its non-realistic art style. Optimization is very much needed here. Some things took so long to render I didn't even get to see them fully rendered. There were frame drops and freezes while I was on ""Performance"" graphics mode. 2. It needs better tutorials. The UI is cluttered with numbers and symbols without any prior explanation. Any in-game tutorial would be welcome, even a help page or something I can read. Same for any new keyword or window page available. One thing I really like is games that ""hide"" certain elements from the UI at the start and the reveal them when they become relevant. 3. Telegraphing is not very good. In this game, you see the action from very far away, so extra indication for attacks would be very welcome. I love that the game expects me to see some guy pulling out a grenade from his pocket from within a group of 4 enemies, but in reality, I'm not going to see that and I have no idea where it's going to land. --- Like I said, I hope the game gets better so I can rewrite this review. I think it has a lot of potential, but I don't want to spoil my experience with an unfinished product.",0.862526893615722656
English,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"From Moon Studios, the award-winning developers of Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps comes No Rest for the Wicked, a visceral, precision Action RPG set to reinvent the genre.",Moon Studios GmbH,No Rest for the Wicked,Private Division,"(Edited after 3 hours of gameplay) I'll start by saying two things. First, it's an Early Access and yes, it's going to be rough around the edges. Second, it's a 34$ Early Access game that the devs themselves presented as ""the future of ARPGs"". It's marketed as a ""reinventing of the genre""... So... an Early Access with high expectations. Performance The game runs fine on my computer with 32 GB ram, i7 processor, RTX 206 graphic card. Despite that, I noticed some stuttering here and there and can easily imagine how poor the performance might be handled by other PCs with lower specs... It seems to be a known issue for Moon Studios. hopefully it gets fixed soon. Starting the prologue with water effects, constant rain and large fires may not have been the wisest call to showcase the potential of the game... It gets better after that. Gameplay Exploration I love the ability to freely move around, pick all kind of strange stuff up for crafting later, mark things down on your map to back track later. This has a lot of potential. The contextual exploration, with the same button being your jump, run and climb movement, is problematic in my opinion. When you want to climb a ledge near to a precipice... well... it's going to be the most exciting thing you do in the playthrough ! Loot or death, only one way to know ! Seems like an odd choice to me. Combat The combat is tedious. Not hard, but extremely tedious. Stamina is key. One swing of your fist takes roughly 30% of your stamina bar. You NEED to have enough for the next dodge or you'll get severely punished. Each encounter can be summed up in ""Hit three times > dodge > replenish your stamina > wait for the next attack > hit three times > dodge..."". Rince and repeat until everything apart from you is dead. Death When you die, you respawn at the last Echo (checkpoint) you used. The enemies do not respawn. You lose some durability on all your equipment. It's not too bad since the game is pretty generous with the amount of armor and backup weapons it gives you and you can always repair everything at a smithy for a small fee. I think it has potential but will probably need some rework for I fear it may become more of a chore at higher levels, when enchanted gear becomes mandatory and having one piece breaking up will be more impacting. To balance this, you don't heal from Echoes. The only way to heal is to either use a consumable, level up... or die and respawn... which you might prefer doing early game rather than consuming resources. Daily quests and random loot The loot and spawning of chests is randomized. They added daily and weekly quests that reward some money and extra equipment. For now I don't mind it at all : it's an Early Access and most chapters aren't released yet. It gives people a better run for their money by adding some more things to do. I simply hope that it won't become the focus after release. Quality of life The game was not ready for early access. A few more weeks would have been a good idea. - No key mapping in 2024 (not even AZERTY support either, so you'll HAVE TO switch to QWERTY to even be able to play) - No clear ability to skip the cutscenes (at least on mouse & keyboard). - The menus feel convoluted. Why not having the option to leave the game in the ESC menu is beyond me... You have to search for the button to exit to the main menu. It's its own quest with an hostage situation. - The basic movement speed of your character is extremely slow, to the point where you'll never lift the finger from the ""Sprint"" button... Let's just revert that and make sprinting the basic movement speed, and add a ""walk"" button. There are a LOT of little things like this, but they pile up quickly. Art direction - The art style is nothing groundbreaking but it's unique and memorable enough. A bit too ""in your face"" sometimes, where you can see that the style took precedence over map readability, performance or gameplay. - That beign said, it's pleasing to explore the different areas. The level design is very well done with branching paths, often several ways to reach an enemy, and rewarding observation. That's probably what shines the most at this time. - The voice-acting is spot on. - The creature and environment designs are great. - The story seems interesting, yet nothing extraordinary either. You play the mute outcast who must proves their worth, as usual. Some evil called ""The Pestilence"" is spreading on an island. It catches the interest of a nearby kingdom and a power struggle between the Church and Nobility ensues while the islanders fight for their own survival. Nothing amazing but it gets the job done. All in all, even for Early Access (and keep in mind, a 34$ one!), it seems like a very premature launch. I can see some ideas in there. Some good, a few excellent. But it needs a LOT more polish to be an enjoyable experience. As is, even for Early Access, I don't think it is a good tribute to ARPGs of the past, and it is certainly not their future ! I'd recommend waiting for updates since it is not worth its pricetag as it is.",0.843383133411407471
English,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"From Moon Studios, the award-winning developers of Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps comes No Rest for the Wicked, a visceral, precision Action RPG set to reinvent the genre.",Moon Studios GmbH,No Rest for the Wicked,Private Division,"Overall rating in its current state: 5/10, which is not high enough for me to really recommend it to others. The game does have potential, though. This review is also written really early with just ~3 hours played and a couple of bosses under my belt, but I'm not enjoying it enough to keep going yet. The good: Sound and art design are top notch. The game has a unique look to it, which I can imagine some people might not like, but I personally enjoy it. Combat feels weighty and can be satisfying at times. I like the idea of the focus system, where even with caster weapons like a staff, you are encouraged to land some melee hits to generate the focus needed to cast spells. In exchange, the spells felt suitably powerful to me, with just a basic fireball from the lowest tier staff doing a surprisingly high amount of damage. The bad: Unfortunately, more to say here, in no particular order: 1. Fall damage feels extreme to me. It feels like you take a notable chunk of damage from some of the shortest falls. While this is something you could get used to and just avoid taking even the smallest of jumps down, this issue is compounded by: 2. The controls. Base movement feels very slow, so I feel encouraged to hold down the sprint key all the time while I'm not in combat. However, the sprint key is also the climb and jump key. Many times I would just be running around trying to find the next fight and my character would get slightly too close to a cliff and just jump off to my death or at least a big loss of HP. You might say ""just get gud and don't run next to cliffs lol"", and you wouldn't be entirely wrong, but it feels needlessly restrictive and just more annoying than anything else. 3. Having to craft food to be able to heal any meaningful amount. This might be a me thing, but I play ARPGs to fight and kill monsters. I have absolutely no interest in running around gathering materials to craft my healing resource. It's not even that difficult to craft a decent amount of food, but I want to interact with the system so little that I still end up running around with very limited healing at any given time. This is made worse by the fact that there is no natural HP regen in town or at whispers (bonfires), leaving me in a situation multiple times where I'd rather just intentionally jump off a cliff to die and reset my HP rather than use one of my precious healing items, as I just didn't want to have to go craft more. Just implement the flask system from Fromsoft games and be done with it. 4. One of my biggest pet peeves is that you don't respawn at the nearest whisper that you've found when you die, you respawn at the last whisper that you've *interacted* with. Multiple times I would leave town, go somewhat far away, make a mistake and die, only to respawn back in town because I forgot to go out of my way to go interact with a closer whisper, then have to make the run again. This is beyond stupid, and I should either A. always respawn at the nearest whisper or B. have a choice about where to respawn. 5. The item durability/repair system has got to go imo, full stop. It is antithetical to this type of game where combat is intentionally quite difficult and you are expected to die multiple times, especially when fighting a difficult boss. You want to go bang your head against a difficult boss until you're able to beat it? You can't. Eventually your gear will break, and eventually you won't have enough money to repair, and you have no option but to go farm weaker, less interesting fights to get enough money to keep going. If I want to just sit there and die repeatedly to the same boss until I am able to beat it, LET ME, that is why I enjoy these type of games. 6. The combat is...flawed. It's weighty and feels impactful, and that's great. Unfortunately, it's more tedious than anything. All enemies follow the same pattern of ""here's an attack pattern of varying length where you might as well just go AFK and wait for it to end, followed by enough downtime for you to hit exactly once, maybe twice, and then back off and wait again"". With the limited healing and overly punishing deaths due to the durability system, you are heavily incentivized to play extremely safe. It is pointless and ineffective to try to go toe-to-toe with even the weakest monster. This makes every encounter exciting at first, but quickly becomes tedious. It gets worse with bosses, as their attack patterns can be super long and have a massive amount of HP, so you're following the above pattern for 2+ minutes straight. 7. Very minor gripe not exclusive to this title at all, but I despise any game where I feel incentivized to run around destroying all breakable objects because they might have loot in them. I can not think of anything more boring to do in a game. Overall: I can see what I think the developers were trying to do, making the game brutal and punishing with skill-based combat, an ARPG designed for a truly hardcore gamer kind of audience. I would generally put myself in that category, but even for me, I think that it's gone too far down that path and they forgot to actually keep the game enjoyable. I do think that it can get to a much better state with just a few tweaks and walking back a few misguided (imo) design decisions. The marketing for this game also really confuses me. It seems they've gone after a lot of content creators for more systems-based ARPGs like D4 or PoE or LE to advertise their game as ""reinventing the genre"" or ""changing ARPGs forever"". The thing is, while those types of games and this one all collectively fall into the ARPG umbrella, they are just not the same genre of game at all, and no sane individual would lump them together. Does it reinvent the genre? No. From what I've played, it's just Dark Souls with an isometric camera.",0.755655467510223389

I'll revisit No Rest For The Wicked again closer to 1.0 when the devs realize how stupidly hard this game is and inevitably fix it. Keep in mind, this is coming from a Souls LOVER who's played these kinds of games from PS3, 360, PS4, XB1 and PS5, all the way up to PC, multiple times over including Sekiro, Bloodborne, all the knock-offs like Code Vein, community mods and everything else. I don't mind a challenge when the challenge feels fair and makes sense, but this game is hard for all the WRONG reasons. And before anyone asks: • Super spongy trash mobs still 80% you in one hit, so every encounter feels artificially drawn out and tedious • Durability loss on death punishes learning enemy move sets (why are we bringing back archaic, failed systems like this?) • Finite meals/potions punishes learning enemy move sets (why are we departing from refillable estus, a system that has worked well for years?) • Way too grindy to replace mats to make more food and repair gear after repeated deaths while learning enemy move sets • Absolutely unforgiving parry windows, and I mean brutal, plus the parry itself still sucks even when you land it (because spongy enemies) • Back stabs are nearly impossible to land and most enemies flat out can't be back stabbed and it's also garbage (because spongy enemies) • Shields aren't 100% block so far, so you're constantly taking damage unless you roll dodge everything (which leaves you with 0 stamina to parry or attack) • Enemies stun lock you very easily • Fighting 2 or more enemies is basically a GG, nearly impossible to win and the aggro range extends past what's visible on screen, so mobs just come running from off-screen constantly to catch you off guard • Sneaking is laughably terrible • You are essentially 'heavy' at all times unless you wear trash armor (I sacrificed other stats to dump 10 points into weight, which is a lot btw, and I still barely fit into the 'normal' range with starter gear, so now my stats are trash and I've gained nothing for it) • Stamina is severely lacking, you're always out of it, even if you understand Souls-like stamina management • Can't easily swap between the 15+ unique meals or potions in your inventory in the heat of combat, plus heals have a LONG cool down for some reason • 'Bonfires' don't restore health or healing items • Inventory is always full and getting it all back to your 'stash' or a vendor is very tedious (plus the stash is way too small) • The amount of backtracking you have to do in this game is absurd so far, which is exacerbated by the hideous and borderline useless map they give us • Fall damage is comically strong • Control scheme gets you killed constantly (you have to tap A to dodge, but you also have to hold it to climb, but holding it also makes you dash, which leads to you accidentally running or rolling off of tight edges way too often, which means you die to the comically strong fall damage, which means your gear takes damage, which means you have to repair it, which means you have to farm again... you see where this is going.) The list goes on and on and on and I haven't even touched on the terrible performance or optimization that everyone else has mentioned. Those are absolutely valid criticisms. You can't have a game suffering from volatile frame rate changes with an air tight combat system like this. It gets you killed. Constantly. And again, before anyone asks, I have great hardware. Liquid cooled 13th gen i9, 64GB of RAM, M.2 drive and a 3080 ti GPU. My game froze completely while trying to edit my character's face. It froze again when talking to the first NPC in the game. It froze again during combat. It constantly drops frames, especially in the main town. Essential parts of the UI are still missing. I've fallen through the map multiple times already. They need to fix all of this and the overall difficulty/balance. The devs have their work cut out for them right now. And I know it's early access (with an emphasis on EARLY), so I'll update this review again after it's had some time to sit in the corner and think about its mistakes. I really want to like this game, but they're making it very hard to. Please devs, stop reinventing the wheel as a triangle. Potential buyers, if you're on the fence, I'd say give it more time to cook. A lot more time. Edit 1: The first hotfix just dropped, which addresses some of the initial issues in my review, but not everything. Definitely a great sign of things to come though and I can tell this game will age well. I'll keep updating this review as more patches are implemented, but it's still a no for me right now. Today, they: • Reduced Durability Damage Taken • Reduced Repair Costs • Increased Drop Rate on Repair Powders • Reduced Stamina Costs • Reduced Fall Damage Curve and more... see the full patch notes for more details. Edit 2: Today was another good step in the right direction. They worked on some performance issues with a tiny dash of durability balance. I will keep updating this review as they improve the game and when I feel like it's in a good place, I will gladly change my review to a thumbsup. This is the entire point of early access. I wish the hateful people in the comments would keep that in mind.

For one, ""context sensitive"" exploration is incredibly rough, having your dodge button also be your sprint button which is also your climb button barely works when there's no exploration, but when there's a focus on poking your nose in the environment and a fixed camera, not having a specific button tied to jumping or sprinting or what have you is incredibly frustrating. Then there's the combat, which feels like someone learned the wrong lessons from other stamina combat games. Lotsa enemy groups which attack in staggered patterns, and don't flinch from your attacks unless they are one of the weapon abilities (which require a resource), or via parry. This means dodging isn't nearly as useful as it is in other stamina games, since avoiding an attack doesn't open up your target as another enemy is now swinging at you as well. Parrying also doesn't feel gratifying as it doesn't really open up anything particularly good, since another enemy can just attack while you're performing it. So what that leads you to is incredibly tedious crowd management where you circle the crowd, wait for all enemies in question to sorta get stuck on eachother or initiate an attack, which leaves you open to actually attack them, and then immediately retreat. Repeat this process until you have enough energy for a special weapon attack to do actual damage or until you slowly whittle down the enemy group. Or the other option, which is just to cook a lot of healing items, and slam your face into combat and just facetank damage while you spam into enemies while they spam at you, but at that point then you're just playing an old ARPG wearing the skin of a new one. Long and short of it: the combat lacks any satisfying impact, the exploration is unrewarding and frustrating due to contextual movement controls, and the game is... technically proficient in terms of art production but the character design is seemingly intentionally hideous which is... fine I guess? Just a strange choice that isn't my bag.",0.703598320484161377

For context, I'm playing on a 4080/13900K at 1440p, and the game can drop into the low 20's in combat. There's also a huge of amount stutter that can kick in during traversal or combat, which adds extra weight to the performance headache. The settings don't really seem to scale, either. Dropping from Max Quality to Performance seems to net me no extra performance. My GPU is locked at 100% for most of the time, so I'm not sure it's a CPU bottleneck. Either way, I really want to like this. From what I've seen so far outside of the performance issues, there's a lot of good and well thought out systems in place. I understand that this is an early access title, but I feel like the performance issues almost make the game unplayable right now. I'd recommend waiting for patches before picking this one up, sadly.",0.67705535888671875

Technical issues, crashes, needs some QOL, etc. Update to this after giving it a fair chance(9-10 hours): I wish I could give this game a neutral rating for the time being. Whilst i don't think it warrants a negative review anymore, it still needs a bit of time in development for me to recommend it. This is mostly due to random crashes and technical issues in some areas. This game gets a lot better the more you play it. Once a lot of the systems start to kick in and you can get better equipment to resolve some of the issues I originally listed below, the game is a lot of fun. There are items to repair during the field without needing to go back to town, better equipment to gather faster, all the issues I was having before start to ease up bit by bit. Gathering gear breaking is still rather annoying, would like to see some random stats(if there is I haven't seen them yet) on them like any other piece. Increased speed, durability, etc. There are some other issues such as the storage in town not being accessible when using upgrade vendors. Random crashes and bugs are expected, weird frame drops in some areas but only when engaging an enemy. Over-all most of my issues listed below are due to the slowness of the early game. Once the pace picks up and you get access to more options such as consumables, the game really gets going and is hopefully worth recommending as the game develops. --------------------------------- Original Negative review below after 3-4hours. I would remove it but it gives a bit of context with my frustrations with the early parts of the game and others might find a similar experience with the durability system. It does get a bit better. --------------------------------- TLDR: Wait till further development/release if you have any self control, you're not missing out on anything by waiting. Durability kind of sucks. This paid demo is a good contender for one of the worst durability implementations in a video game. Almost beating out Dark Souls 2 on its initial release before it was patched/DLC. (The paid demo part is a joke. If you are offended by this, don't be. I am aware what Early Access is and have nothing against devs using it to help develop their game. A lot of amazing games have come from Early Access) The durability system kind of sucks and its really the only part of the game I found poorly implemented as it just stops you from getting back to the good stuff(the entire rest of the game) Whenever you die, your equipment start to break and the only way to repair it is to go back to a vendor. If your gear breaks after too many attempts on a boss, you now have to either have backup gear for the combat style you're running or go find a vendor that can repair your stuff. When doing any parkour sections, taking off your gear is often the best way to manage durability loss. The gathering equipment breaks whilst you're trying to gather/mine, etc and if you don't have a backup in your very limited size inventory you're shit out of luck. The gathering animation is also a little bit too long at around 5 seconds per gather. This can all easily result in a death spiral where you can't afford to repair your equipment as it gets more expensive. No one is asking for an easy mode, the game difficulty over-all is pretty on point. Durability in video games isn't even a bad system, however in this game I don't think it is implemented well. It is entirely possible as the player gets further into the game most of these issues fade away, but its yet to be seen. The rest of the game is a lot of fun, from combat, to visuals, atmosphere, music and enemy design. All fantastic. Conclusion: The game is over-all pretty good but I can't recommend the game in its current state. One of the core mechanics kind of sucks to play with. There are some performance issues and crashes even on fairly high-end rigs. It has a fair way to go and even though I am giving this a negative review, I have a lot of faith in this dev team based on their previous titles and look forward to its release somewhere in the future. If I find the game more enjoyable in the future my mind is more than open to being changed into a positive review.",0.670836269855499268

I would highly recommend waiting to get the game until they give the ability to move camera at the very least. On other notes this game is not an ARPG do not let them lie to you this is a souls game first and foremost with how combat plays and the lack of a skill tree. The world is beautiful and the combat is pretty smooth so it does have that going for it. I dont know how loot is because 3 hours in and I havent gotten anything past common other than a ring that increases my equip load. Enemies are well designed for the most part other than the bomb enemies because they will spam that attack even in melee range and just ruin any plans of yours to parry them. TLDR; Good game but horrible fixed camera and too much forced parkour thats more likely to kill you then the enemies makes it really hard to recommend.,0.655198931694030762

DO NOT BE DELUDED WITH NEGATIVE REVIEWS, MINE INCLUDED. These DEVs will make anything to make their game better with the feedback they have. First of all, the good sides: Amazing graphics and cool setting Hitting feels... Yeah, I feel like Mike Tyson. Cool attacking designs Great environment sounds The Bad sides: FPS (still playable, but has some lows from time to time) (FIXED AFTER DAY 1 UPTADE) Stamina (very annoying, you need lots of food and face tank) Parry (parry window should be bigger and use no stamina) Bosses or other monsters perma attack you so it is very difficult to fight if number is more than one due to stamina issues and how fast they attack and how slow we are compared to them. Keybinds (You wont believe how many times I died falling) Camera Angle (It is not clear whether I am on an edge or there is a small rock I can climb on) Map (I swear I do not know where I should go XD When I open the map it is difficult to see whether there is a wall there or the place connects to another area or no. I was lost... a lot of time... Maybe a clearer draw for the walls can be better?) Price tag (a little bit high for an early access game) (Forgot to add) Need a bit more customization to be honest. It has so little options with hair styles and beards etc. Item Levels ((FIXED AFTER DAY 1 UPTADE) ) Bugs: I think that cave mission with the ""touch the tree"" stuff is bugged if you die. Because, on the mission it says something like ""Oh we couldnt find the way back to the mission guy (cuz I died falling thanks to camera angles and keybinds) I must go back and touch the tree again"" yet after I run back and touch the tree I could not go back to the mission guy because the wall was blocked off? I run around the cave 5-6 times everywhere and couldnt find a place to go even though it says ""climb higher""??? Conclusion: I still recommend the game for you to try if you dont mind giving this much money to an early access title. I do trust the DEVs, they do care about their game and willing to work for it. Also, there will be CO-OP too which I am waiting. This game has future, and if you like to participate in it give it a go. For me it is going to be a long-term game anyway and once the developers fix these issues it is very easy one of the GAME OF THE YEAR title.",0.64220041036605835

I enjoy souls-like difficult games, had no issues platinum'ing Sekiro and the like. This should be right up my alley. However there are a handful of irritating design choices in this game that make it joylessly difficult, at least in the early game. Clearly it wants me to grind for materials, and yet my inventory is capped? I have no idea what is worth keeping. All healing items have to be restocked by collecting materials that run out? Very tedious. Every enemy hits like a tank and has twice the reach I do and seemingly three times the stamina. Might be a me problem in how I'm trying to play, but the weapons and gear it's given me hasn't left me many options. The single button parkour for traversal is a little odd, has lead to accidental deaths a few times. ""Bonfires"" don't heal? Doesn't (seem to) behave like a souls game in that regard. Also, lack of easier fast travel is gonna kill me. Seems to take forever to get anywhere - maybe I'm slow because the only gear it's given me is insanely heavy. Also, the speed at which that first boss ganks you is a bit extreme, especially since it seems to enjoy immediately smashing you up against the invisible wall that appears on the door you enter.

I haven't played any souls-like games before and thought this might be a good way to give the genre a try, but the game feels incredibly punishing to someone like me who is not good at parrying/dodging. My primary issue is with the durability system. If the game allowed you to die repeatedly to learn the mechanics, I would be able to just learn with experience. However, if you die too many times all your gear breaks and then you're left with no usable weapons or armor trying to fight enemies that are already challenging to you in order to get money to repair your equipment. I literally decided I would just beat the first boss with just fists since I got so tired of having to keep repairing my sword, and now that I am past the first boss I can't even use my sword if I wanted to due to the cost to repair it.

The game is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous and the world has so much potential. It's in early access so they are actively looking for feedback, which is great. Here are some things that need to change: Weapon durability system: This has to be the worst weapon durability system I've ever experienced. Your weapon degrade as you use them, they degrade severely when you die, and it costs quite a bit to repair at the blacksmith. Yes, you can farm for money with re spawning resources, but it destroys large parts of the fun factor. Healing items: You don't get a set healing item that respawns at check points such as an estus flask. I get it, it's not dark souls. However, you have to hunt for healing recipe materials to have any healing. Not to mention that CHECKPOINTS DO NOT HEAL YOU AT ALL. You cannot even heal in town until you build an inn. The stagger system: This may be a thing only I have a problem with. The stagger with weapons is very inconsistent. Even witha two handed strength weapon, the smallest enemy can poise through it and hit you. I think it makes the combat inconsistent, and for a game with such brutal combat and lack of healing, it makes the combat feel unfair at times. Inventory Management: For a game with so much loot and resources that are required for you to advance, the inventory is very limited. Yes, you can upgrade the capacity of your inventory as you progress but this game is just so punishing in all the aforementioned ways, this just seals the deal. Don't buy this game yet boys.

They've known about it for over 2 years now and refuse to fix something so simple while knowing what the root cause of it is and know what exactly to fix. Just to give you an idea of how little they care... I brought this up before and during my time working there and it was never fixed. We're now going into 2023 with this vulnerability that's been in the game for over 4+ years. Still think BHVR cares about you now? Their main focus is and always has been to make money and that's why this issue has never been addressed even though their own Fog Whisperers like Otzdarva, Elix and many others have questioned why they haven't fixed it yet and are victims to these issues. Their priorities are all over the place and have no idea how to run a game company let alone keep the community safe. It's pretty evident that these are the facts. They would rather ban innocent people than to solve the huge security risks and flaws in the game. It's disgusting and this type of ""behaviour"" should not be condoned. I'm more surprised Valve/Steam is even allowing the game to remain playable on their platform considering the company refuses to fix these issues that is allowing these events take place. Cheaters?

The game lures people into gambling addiction!!! If you're online enough, you could have seen people complaining over the fact that they don't really appreciate Dead by Daylight but they are unable to quit it. The fun fact is the game that is based a lot on RNG factors, aka luck, and tries to look ""competetive"" develops gambling addiction. You win, then you lose, after that you go for another match to show off your skills of defeating the unfair events and survive or killl every survivor. It's addiction is based on a constant feeling of irritation, the developers acknowledged it during one of their interviews. Gambling addiction funnily comes from losing, not winning. You will be annoyed by everything. By one of the most toxic communities, by poor balance decisions, countless bugs. Despite bringing the feeling of satisfaction sometimes, your mental state overall will be worse by the end of most play sessions. You won't play this game because you like it, you will play it because you're addicted to the constant feeling of surpassing the irritation. And the worst part is that you will feel rewarded because of the fact that you outsmarted players who are there to mock you and verbally abuse you by the end of a game. It's not healthy no matter how you look at it. Even if you have ""thick skin"", it's simply unenjoyable to waste your time on such people when you think about it. Talking about the other reasons why I can't recommend this game: - It requires you to waste too much time grinding and paying. Licenced characters can only be purchased via real money and if you want to get original ones for free, you need to put 100 hours for each character. And there are so many of them, it may take 1000, if not more, hours to gain them all for free. - The developers work on their game when they WANT. The reason for that is the fact that this game does not have any competition. This brings flaws and small patches that do not really feel drastic and entertaining. Moreover, if the upcoming changes are disliked by the community, they will be rolled anyways since what can people do, find another Dead By Daylight? Money were put into creation of the things players didn't like, get it or leave. Oh, wait, you won't. - The game feels dull. We have no new content despite new killers and perks that kind of change gameplay. The issue here is that the perks don't do much, currently the game has a few strong perks that the community takes and the other perks are not being used at all unless a player wants to feel less powerful for some reason. And the killers often feel dull as well. Instead of constantly working on the previous perks and killers the developers prefer to make new perks and killers for the sake of pumping up money. They rarely change anything, it's lucky to have a patch with some big interesting changes at least once a year. - The developers obviously lean towards the side that brings more money with the help of the cosmetics. It's not a secret that killer issues take much more time to be solved than the survivor ones. It brings unfairness into the game in certain cases. - Moderation on the Steam and the official forums will literally ban you for showing any concern about the game's health. If you complain too much, well, stop spreading negativity. This creates a false sense of positivity when the community is furious at BHVR. - The support isn't really helpful and deals with many issues quite poorly. The in-game report system only flags certain players, they won't get banned if you press a few buttons there. To have a person banned for sure you need to take extensive amount of steps and most of the times you need proof. So if you don't have your games recorded, you can't sumbit tickets to support effectively. - They have started doing limited time payed content, they even took out certain cosmetics that existed before that decision. Feels icky, you can see how they try to pump the money out of you. - You will have to close your comment section. I've never seen a community being this obsessed with leaving toxic comments on your profile. Please, do not support this mess. It looks fun on the outside but it's a mess. ---- I would like to mention one pretty significant thing about the game's developers that had happened at some point. The community asked for colorblind setting for more than 4 years. This request had been dismissed until some point when the scandal occured because of it. One of the developers called the whole thing boring. Clearly they aren't interested in wasting resources on something that won't bring them much income. The game has lost it's initial charm long time ago and has nothing passionate about it. ---- 2024 UPDATE: the issues are the same and now I get how gambling addiction ruins lives of people.",0.929416954517364502

Sadly I've come to find that PC players are just as ignored as console when it comes to BHVR. Dead by Daylight is an incredible product that is trapped underneath the thumb of idiots who don't know what to do with it. Every update just adds more bugs than features. At one point, years ago, Cote had described the game as ""no longer theirs, it now belonged to the community"" which at the time I thought was beautiful. Years later, however, after new hires like Ethan, the game has belittled, ignored, and straight up asked veterans to leave. DBD releases ptb's to put up a front that they listen to the community while then releasing multiple patches like The Twins, and Mid Chapter 4.5 that completely ignore the complaints of the community. After how many new things broke today, I finally had enough that I was going to submit individual bug tickets to them for every bug they've been neglecting, only to find out they've updated their website to hide bug tickets at the very bottom and shrunk the box to a 5th of the previous size, while having added tons of pictures and ads for the game, and top centering a small FAQ style technical support for things already fixed. BHVR is a company that actively disrespects their community, herds morons like sheep into defending their actively bad decisions by posting occasional memes, and milks the game and its players by working minimally and at their own whim while we beg and plead for them to just acknowledge they heard what we have to say. I'm ashamed I've spent so many years of my life believing in and supporting a game that left me behind years ago without me noticing.",0.925763845443725586

The design of (most) killers, gameplay, chase interaction and being able to play with friends or by myself. I have invested 4 years of game time into DBD. Currently sitting at just over 4K hours total. I've played through all eras of the game and all the ups/downs bugs/problems the game has had. Pre this latest patch the game was sitting at its best point in terms of playability. It absolutely had a myriad of problems but they weren't game breaking and my love for the game helped me to see past them. However, this latest update is an absolute spit in the face to anyone who has invested any serious amount of time into the game at all. The developers changed multiple things that nobody asked for, received the feedback that nobody liked it and implemented the changes anyway. I have been playing online games for years and BEhaviour are by FAR the worst developers at both time management, choosing what to focus their resources on and ESPECIALLY player feedback. They do not listen. Even besides the changes nobody asked for and how poorly they were implemented this newest update has also not only has more incredibly unfun breakable walls added and a shitty UI but a myriad of literal game breaking bugs. Walls with no collision, areas of the map (auto haven bus) where the killer CANNOT pass through but the survivor can- which was completely fine last patch AND on the PTB (test servers). The developers stumbled upon a cash cow and just release skin after skin, DLC after DLC, battlepass after battlepass with no care for the people who helped build their game. They balance the game to the casuals and do not care about their core playerbase as they constantly have new players coming in dropping money on DLC's/cosmetics. I do not want to target anyone specifically but they mention in livestreams that they ""use the wiki"" to know what certain perks do- they do not even know their own game. The lead game designer who I won't name is an absolute moron, his views on the game are INCREDIBLY bad and having someone like that helm the ship is HORRIBLY unhealthy for a good player experience. For 4 years time players have been asking for a colorblind mode in order to be able to play the game as some people were unable to see scratch marks due to their condition. For 4 years we were told ""its not on our priority list"". Only when the community REALLY made a big fuss about it did they release that they were ""happy to announce we are working on colorblind filters"". They do not care about the player, only their image. When the last absymal twins update game out riddled with bugs they were very quick to change Moris- something players have been asking to be changed for years, an incredibly easy fix. The only reason it was changed then was to take the spotlight away from how disgusting and unprofessional their released DLC was. I cannot state enough how little they care about their playerbase. I absolutely love Dead By Daylight. But in its current state and with the way the developers handle their game I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Do not buy this product. This is now the second major update in a row that has come RIDDLED with bugs/problems. Please do not support this game.",0.920907437801361084

A large chunk of the playerbase plays just to torment others in ways transcending the game. They will do anything they can in a match with a sole purpose of making you miserable and then throw insults and mock you after the match. If you abide by their ""rules"" and play nice, you will likely loose and they will flame you anyway. Both survivor and killer players are stuck in a gameplay loop that is inherently unfun for both sides in higher levels of play -it's the most ""optimal"", but also just boring and frustrating for everyone. Many perks are greatly unbalanced, dominating the game. As killer you will feel absolutely powerless and helpless while survivors dance in front of you and mock you. As survivor, you will get targetted by frustrated killers and tunneled out of the game early. It's a vicious cycle of hatred, ""us vs them"" mentality and frustration. Many people call themselves toxic and wear it as a badge of honour, acting accordingly. The devs have a history of not acknowledging the state of the community and leaving features (and exploits) in the game that are there specifically to bully players and have nothing to do with actual gameplay. They even told people having issues to play another game in one of their past streams. Therefore, it's unlikely it will ever get better. This issue extends to accessibility issues, as there are macroes people use purely to annoy others, that cause rapidly flashing lights and a persisting drilling sound, that may cause severe headaches or even seizures in photosensitive people. Poor understanding of the high levels of play by the devs results in highly questionable balance. That, combined with the aforementioned overwhelming toxicity has caused the game to hemorrhage players over the last years. Another issue that the game has had for about 2 years now, is an overwhelming amount of hackers. Getting hacks is easy and many people use them. Many of those hacks are subtle enough that you won't know for sure if it's hacking or they are just lucky or good (especially since you don't always see what they are doing). If you caught them redhanded, they will gaslight you and tell you you are the problem instead. The hacks range from simple things like faster movement, repair speed and automated perfect dodge, to wild things like teleports, instant repair/totem cleanse, freezing the killer in an action they can't cancel or preventing the match to ever end for you even after a timer, forcing you to disconnect (which removes all your points, challenge progress and applies a timed matchmaking ban). They have also been shown capable of digging out your IP address through the game. Some streamers were even swatted due to that. These issues haven't been addressed at all by the devs and continue to exist untouched. The core gameplay is addicting in its own way and will keep bringing you back. Then you will have a horrible experience and leave the game. And come back after forgetting how bad it was. I've defended this game for years, even recommended it to friends cause it has fun things about it. The characters are incredibly well designed, the art department in general is phenomenal. There are also many horror icons that are cool to experience in a game. The core gameplay is fun until you reach high levels of play and there are many killers - each with their own unique gameplay style. The lore has been expanded over time and by now it's rich and well written - a real treat for those who care. However, the toxicity and gameplay has been getting worse and worse over the years and at this point, the state of it is so fundamentally rotten, that even the associated content creators of the game struggle to have fun playing it (especially killer mains). To sum it up - the game can be really entertaining early on, but don't fall for that. You will end up having a horrible time and if you get too involved in the game, it will be hard to stop playing for good. You will always come back and have a bad time again. It's going downhill in terms of balance, community health and even security. Until these issues are properly addressed and proper steps are taken, I can't recommend this game to anyone. And sadly, with how long it's been going, I don't see them being addressed in neither near nor far future.",0.89865875244140625

I also play both killer and survivor. So where do I even begin with this? I think we did a pretty good job so far For me, the game in it's objective is the exact same as it was years ago when the game launched. The script has never been deviated from. What even is a win? Is getting hatch a win? Did you win if you ran the killer for 5 gens and your 3 teammates got out but you died? On the killer side is 3k a win if the 4th survivor gets hatch? No one knows and everyone interprets it differently. Even the devs can't give an answer and it's THEIR game. When streamers do escape streaks or kill streaks, they have to outline what the rules are because the game doesn't differentiate. Notable updates and changes take so long to be implemented. This makes the game feel stale. How long did it take to fix keys? Moris? Both sides were given such powerful tools that they could use to make the other side's experience miserable and it took years for changes to be implemented. New maps have been so few and far between over the past couple of years. The graphical reworks are stunning, and the devs deserve tremendous credit for that, but ultimately the maps are the same with a new lick of paint, the novelty wears off after just a few games. Speaking of things that never seem to change, the survivor meta has been the same for three, four years? Dead hard, Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike are your staples with the only new introduction being Circle of Healing. A perk so strong that the devs are now struggling to balance it. The killer meta has changed, but the strongest perks have always been the ones that slow down gen progression. Unfortunately, as effective as these are, they make for an incredibly boring experience when playing survivor. Remember Forever Freddie? Yeah I try to forget too. MMR No one wants to play a game and get stomped on so playing with and against players at your skill level, particularly for newer players is great; in theory. The reality has been completely different, does anyone have a good word to say about MMR? The old ranking system was far from perfect but it felt more natural, and you could see ranks. The current visible ranking system is pretty much correlated with your playtime and doesn't mean anything; it only impacts on the number of bloodpoints you'll get at rank reset. The determining factor on who you are matched with comes from the SBMMR which is invisible to all players, so you never actually know what level you're at. Luckily there a few clear giveaways that you're at high MMR. If you're playing as survivor then you will most likely be playing against Nurses and Blights, with the odd Leatherface and Huntress thrown in. You will very rarely see any other killers. Why? Because the difference in power level with those listed above, particularly Nurse and Blight are far superior to every other killer who will get stomped at the highest level. A top level Nurse can probably down an entire team in around the same time it takes Trapper to gather and place his traps. Y'all remember when Nurse could Blink five times consecutively? Fun memories. As well as playing against the same killers every single game, you'll see a lot of sweaty strats. Everyone can play the game however they like, this isn't a criticism just an observation. At high MMR you will be camped, you will be tunnelled and yes, they most definitely have NOED. The main issue with NOED is that it contributes so heavily to kill rates which the devs are then seemingly use to make decisions on balancing. From the killer's perspective, what are they supposed to do? In my opinion, the survivor is the power role, not as a solo, but if the killer is facing a 4 man SWF at the highest level? You've probably already lost multiple gens in your first chase. At high MMR this will be your experience every other game. There is an absolute irony that you try so hard to ""win"" to increase a rank you can't even see, to make your in game experience more and more miserable with every success. Doing gens, you? The survivor experience. You'll be camped. You'll be tunnelled. If you do your objective too quickly then you'll be called a gen rusher which then means you're fair game, apparently. In solo, salty survivors will kill themselves on hook or dc on first down. Play for hatch. GGEZ The killer experience. There is a lot of hypocrisy on the topic of toxicity, as the killer you drew the short end of the stick, congrats. You've probably heard of the survivor rulebook. You probably thought it was a joke; no it is very real but there is one fundamental flaw, it changes from person to person. There are a couple of key ones though. First, don't camp. Yes that includes if the survivor on hook's teammates have just bombed the hook, you gotta take a stroll to the other side of the map and let them heal. That's survivor rulebook 101 my friend. Don't tunnel. This one is tricky because some people genuinely don't understand what tunnelling is and have their own interpretation. Oh and no Lightborn. All the sick survivor plays involve flashlights, so you're practically hacking if you run Lightborn. Having a flashlight on macro isn't annoying you're just tilted. Booping the Snoot = free escape. Teabagging isn't toxic. If you run NOED then you're a little bitc...well you know. Now here's the best part, most important rule of them all actually so listen up, it doesn't matter if you followed every single rule, it doesn't matter which killer you played, which perks or add ons you used, it doesn't matter how the survivors played, good or bad, if you ""won"" the game, you played incorrectly. Confusing right? Survivors hate losing and they'll have no problem telling you everything you did to seemingly ruin their experience. But if the survivors ""win""? You're going straight to teabag central at those exit gates and you'll probably get hit with the GGEZ in the post game. The classic. And this brings me to probably the single biggest issue with DBD. The Community The DBD community is one of the most toxic I have ever had the displeasure to be a part of. Not the entire community, I have had many positive memorable interactions, but for every one of those, I can recount at least ten bad ones. The way the DBD community treats each other is, at times, horrific. My Xbox inbox is filled with hundreds of messages from players I met on DBD, salty that they lost. It was only when I started watching DBD content on YouTube and Twitch that I realised I wasn't the only one getting messages like these, particularly when playing killer. Within the space of an hour on Steam, I was called a re***d by one SWF and then told to kill myself by another. What had I done to get that reaction? I killed them and ""won"" the game. I've seen countless interactions like this on YouTube, many far worse and there are absolutely zero consequences. The devs stick their fingers in their ears and refuse to acknowledge this kind of thing goes on. Using the in game report feature is the equivalent to writing something on a piece of paper, scrunching it up and then lobbing it in the bin. Whilst whatever happens in game, should stay in game, there has to be accountability for those who use racist, homophobic or otherwise serious abusive behaviour towards other players. How could I possibly recommend DBD to anyone? Game communities should be a safe space for its members, DBD is not it. Anyway I've rambled on for far too long so I'm going to take some advice and I'm going to play something else. Maybe I'll try Civilisation or something.",0.865623235702514648

Firstly, certain elements of this game are incredibly unbalanced. The map system in this game is complete garbage, and even though I am a survivor main with 75% of my hours across all platforms being that of a survivor, most of the maps in this game are ruthless for killers. I wouldn't say this game is survivor sided, as realistically a ""scummy"" killer can hold all the power in a game by simply going against the ""survivor rulebook for killers"", but it is still brutal. Multiple videos providing evidence for this can be found online, including videos from Demi, Tru3Talent, etc. From broken loops to sweat squads with locker flashlighting on dead dawg saloon, the potential to destroy a killer's motivation to play this game is definitely there. Secondly, after 1000 hours in this game, you would expect to be able to have all perks for all characters on at least half of the cast for one of the sides. I am sure if you were ridiculously efficient with how you spend your bloodpoints form the VERY beginning of the game, then it just might be barely possible. Tier systems for perks in this game are outdated and needs to be completely removed for both sides. This would avoid needed thousands of hours to be able to play any killer however you want, and play any survivor how you want as well. I'm aware changing survivors doesn't really matter too much, but for killers this is a really big deal. Lastly, mmr is complete trash. The ""ranking"" system in dbd has never been accurate and probably never will be. Ironically the current ""grade"" system is better at ranking than the mmr ""ranking"" system. I'm aware in a game like this it is hard to create a sustainable ranking system, but just slapping a bad system onto it and calling it a day is not a solution. Every new patch in dbd seems to make the game slightly more unplayable for both sides, but mostly for killers. Everyone runs the same 4 perks out of a pool of 6 or 7 on both sides, and it's ridiculous how little variety there is in this game. Half of the excellent perks are locked behind paywalls (which whilst not an issue for myself personally, is a giant issue for a 5 year old game). This is no longer a game that I have an infinite amount of passion for like I used to. I have played this game (on console) from just after it's launch, but repeatedly came back as I found the concept to be original and enticing. Back in late 2018 I switched to the PC version, stopped playing yet again but in 2019 was drawn back into it again. This was probably the peak of dbd for myself and a lot of others, as whilst it was unbalanced it was nowhere near as hellish as it currently is. I met some lifelong friends through this game so will always be grateful to it, and it will always hold a special place to me as far as a game can. If you are thinking of getting this game, be prepared to sink thousands of hours into it before being able to play at an optimal level. I wish you luck, and hope you grow to love this game as much as I did.",0.864129245281219482

Never before have I had so little confidence in a studio's ability to perform basic tasks until I played Dead By Daylight. Bugs that would take a normal developer hours to fix would take BHVR weeks. In-game concepts that are common knowledge to the community are often lost on, or completely ignored by BHVR. You can expect balance changes that will leave you baffled and scratching your head because on a fundamental level, Behaviour Interactive does not understand their own game, nor do they intend to. Devs past and present exude elitism out of every pore as though they know what's best for the game, and the community knows nothing. Several glaring issues such as a heavy grind, a lack of diversity in recent characters, and power creep are sure to go unaddressed because BHVR both don't know or care about their game.

I hit ""not recommended"" because most of the recommended reviews do not mention any problems. I did enjoy this game, but I feel it has a flaw that seriously mitigates it in the long term. This game is a great time with friends and it is fun to progress, get loot, and furnish your ship. However, the game is set up where there is no ending, however the quota will keep rising until it is unachievable and you will die as a result. You can't even make save files, so once you are ""fired"" your whole campaign is gone. By the time the quota got too high to meet, my friends and I all agreed we wished we could continue buying new gadgets and progressing. So I'd say it either needs an ending other than death, or the quota should rise slower, and eventually plateau. (the plateau could be higher depending on a difficulty setting.) You should also be able to load back to previous saves. Edit: I hit not recommended because I wanted my criticisms to stand out, and I feared hitting ""recommended"" would bury it in the echo chamber of reviews saying the game is perfect. I wish Steam had a middle option... I see why people are upset I would do that when I have all these hours in the game, but when I look for criticisms in games I often filter by not recommended to find them. I do recommend this game, but unlike 99% of the positive reviews I have some suggestions. Also, you don't have to agree with my suggestions and it shouldn't offend you if don't.

Being a fan of the Souls games as well as Bloodborne, I found myself in familiar territory with Sekiro, but something just wasn't quite clicking. All the new systems function well, and the setting is expertly crafted, but it's the stripped away RPG elements that leave me feeling empty with Sekiro. For me, so much of the enjoyment of the Soulsborne games came from exploring the intricately designed areas and finding strange little nooks and crannies containing unique weapons and/or armor. It felt like an interesting and satisfying reward for exploration. In Sekiro, every item you find in the world is more or less a consumable (with few exceptions), and that sense of wonderment feels lost. I feel no desire to explore secondary paths knowing that they all end in yet another pocketful of confetti. That sense that each pathway could potentially result in a weapon that changes your whole playstyle (if you want it to) is no longer present. This drawback also bleeds into my second issue with Sekiro: Being locked into a singular playstyle. Again, to reference the Soulsborne franchise, FromSoft games have always come with a variety of ways to build your character. Do you want to be a heavily armored brute with a two handed axe? Have at it. Want to be a robe-wearing mage? Go nuts. How about a holy Paladin type that hurls lightning-spears from behind a shield? Whatever floats your boat. On the flip side, Sekiro takes the approach of ""learn the new parry/block system or die."" Without having the previous FromSoft titles as reference, this isn't a bad thing in and of itself. The system works well and has a good deal of polish; it's the fact that it represents yet another facet of RPG-oriented gameplay that has been stripped away from FromSoft's design philosophy. The world itself also feels much more linear than that of the Soulsborne titles. To compare Sekiro to Bloodborne or Dark Souls, it's clear that FromSoft was less interested in the intricate world building they're so well known for. The levels are gorgeous and well crafted, but are much simpler and straight forward. The lore is not nearly as cryptic and expansive, and the host of characters are far less enigmatic. Again, not an objectively negative trait, just... Not what I admire about FromSoft titles. In a vacuum, this game is fantastic on a technical level.

I will replay this game sometime soon and see if my feelings have changed on it. Until then, I encourage any readers to look at positive reviews. If you're on the fence, you'll probably at least somewhat enjoy it. --------------------------------------------------- Original Review Below: Cdr. William T. Riker's review said it best: There needs to be a middle option. A ""Great Game, but Not for Me"" Button. Pros: + Yet another title by Hidetaka Miyazaki with some of the most fantastic visual presentation out there. The care that goes into the environments in his games is not to be ignored, with certain areas looking fucking beautiful. + Mobility and verticality are two areas Sekiro improves upon, with every area feeling fully accessible, and exploration constantly rewarding you with interesting diverging paths and optional encounters. + Storytelling has had its ups and downs in the Souls series, with your character essentially being a blank slate that pieces things together from interactions and lore. Sekiro's story, however, feels somewhat more fleshed out, and the area of Ashina (and its surrounding locations) tends to show more of the downfall of the city, even going so far as to humanize the enemy more than most others game have so far. This seems to be a common trend for Miyazaki's ""Souls-But-Not-Souls"" games, as Bloodborne did very well in this aspect as well. + Captures the feeling of ""being a Shinobi"" pretty well, with a mixture of gadgets and special techniques in your arsenal, and a focus on stealth that has never quite been realized in the series before outside of backstabs. Even bosses can be hit with this to guarantee a cheap free shot, with speedrunners finding ways to abuse the system to make some bosses laughable. And the tools are enjoyable to use, with some upgrades and skill unlocks feeling particularly badass. + The music is fantastic and boss fights are very memorable despite mostly being humanoid. Some bosses, in particular, are a little TOO memorable (looking at you, Headless). Cons: - Difficulty (1): There is a huge discussion piece for this game right now. I do not think the game needs an easy mode, but I do think that the game is far less satisfying than any given Dark Souls game. There are a lot of flaws that make the game frustrating to anyone who aren't at ""git gud"" levels: the need to farm to use tools if you're not good at conserving them, the severe punishments for dying frequently (arguably far worse than the rest of the games in some ways), the absurd staggering that can occur if you take a hit that leads to you taking MORE hits, the lack of animation canceling, the absurd boss tracking (in particular a certain boss in the fucking beginning who manages to grab you when you're miles away behind him)... it's engineered to punish more than any other game has so far. - Difficulty (2): Boss difficulty is an oddity in this game as well. Some are frustrating but enjoyable to study and deal with, such as your fight against Genichiro (and a certain returning enemy in the same place you fight Genichiro). Others, like the final boss, enjoy constant move spam, staggering attacks, and the ridiculous ""RED MOVE"" where you have to make a split second realization as to whether you should dodge, jump, or parry/interrupt. The red move is the most annoying of the mix, as the game encourages you to discern what you should do based on the posture or movement of the boss. However, this felt incredibly inconsistent and frustrating to attempt to do in battle unless the enemy was pushing forward and you have the ability to counter it by stepping on their weapon. What ended up happening was that for these bosses I'd simply die again, and again, and again until, eventually, by way of throwing my face at a problem enough, I'd eventually win through luck and anger. - Difficulty (3): I feel like there has to be a discussion on what value we gain from a game being ""difficult"", and where we draw the line. This goes beyond some stupid argument about 'accessibility' (I'm sure there are people with disabilities or a lack of interest in games who can whip my ass at this game), instead focusing on the concept of enjoyment. I beat Sekiro, I sat down and fought every boss and lost, and tried again and lost, and studied, and looked up strategies, and examined speedrunners, and ""got good"". I even did it, more or less, like the game wanted: in their face, parrying moves, making judgements and dashing at the right times. It took me 33 hours, which is a far shot from other people's playthroughs. But for once in the series, I absolutely hated the experience. It's not the first time the game has had cheap moments, but it is the first time I've left the game's ending feeling zero enthusiasm for repeating the experience or any sense of satisfaction. It's the difference between the uphill climb of a Dark Souls game and Sekiro cunt-punting you off a cliff and throwing you a dagger to climb back up with. Yeah, given enough time and unlimited retries, I could maybe pull it off - but why would I want to? - Items have never felt more useless in the series. A lack of meaningful weapons or armors seriously downgrades the experience, where the only items you'll find that are genuinely great to find are gourd seeds, a tool (most of which are purchased anyway), or Divine Confetti, which is basically essential in some fights. Most of the other items, while having various uses, barely ever feel necessary or a boon to help you, either offering too little to be worth casting or requiring too much to be worth using. This ties into an overwhelming sense of ""why"" when it comes to exploration. You do meet new people and find optional encounters, and they're certainly INTERESTING to move around in with the aforementioned verticality of your grapple hook -- but at the end of it all, your rewards for doing so are usually nothing. - A lack of playstyle variety is a significant issue as well, and a complete departure from one of the fundamental enjoyable aspects of Miyazaki's games: choice. You learn the Parry System and you use your katana as your main damaging weapon, and that's it. The minimal ammo system for the tools means it is virtually impossible to only use them, and even if you could their uses are meant to compliment your sword, not replace it. - Majority of the unlocked skills, while badass to look at, do very little in terms of damage and often leave you vulnerable. - A lack of multiplayer, while understandable, is a significant blow to any sort of community being built around the game. Overall: After 33 hours, I can safely say I beat the game. And... I cannot say that Sekiro is a bad game. Time and money and care went into this experience. It is a whole package, completely free from the usual overtly-predatory bullshit we see in games a lot these days. It played smoothly, it ran well on my system. And, ultimately, not all of it was awful - there were some fights that were genuinely fun to experience, and glimpses of the original intensity and enjoyment the souls games bring. But as an individual, I just did not like this game overall. Dark Souls games have always had a bit of difficulty and frustration to them, but this one was so overt while lacking a lot of the things that brought about my personal enjoyment in the series. At the end of the day, the button asks if I recommend this game. And I do not. BUT, look at other people's opinions about it. Maybe it's more suited to you.",0.732896924018859863

However, unlike with From Software’s previous titles, I would not recommend this to the average gamer looking for a tough-but-fair experience, which is why I opted to give it a “would not recommend” label instead. I wish there was a “mixed” option, or a way to simply write a review without being forced to labelling a game as positive or negative, but there isn’t. That said, I would thoroughly recommend Sekiro to you if you enjoy sitting down and intently studying move sets of enemies and bosses, not minding repeated re-tries until you eventually figure out how to react to each of their attacks on an order of magnitude way above the Souls series; and if you liked the parry system in the Dark Souls series, because, at its core, Sekiro is largely a parry game. These are my thoughts on the game so far, roughly 20 hours in. It is possible that some of the observations and assumptions in the following write-up will change, however, it is unlikely. I have meanwhile beaten the game (~30 hours) and my opinions remain largely unchanged! If anything, my issues with the game got exacerbated by the design of the last few areas and bosses. Combat & Combat-related Combat feels overly punishing at times, and requires persistent mastery over the game magnitudes higher than any previous From Software games did. Minibosses, bosses and even most regular enemies push out intense damage, commonly being able to kill Wolf with 2-3 attacks. Most* bosses and minibosses can only feasibly be killed by building up their posture gauge, which is mostly done by deflecting their attacks; requiring near perfect moveset knowledge from the player before they have any real chance of defeating them. Bosses tend to have checkpoints close to their boss arenas, however, minibosses do not. Additionally, miniboss arenas tend to have other enemies placed in them. Whenever you die to a miniboss, you are forced to clear out the entire arena of regular enemies before you can engage the miniboss again. In arenas with 7-10 other creatures on patrol paths that require you to sneak around and wait for them to patrol past you, this gets tedious quick. Certain types of enemies can only be properly damaged by using certain items. Those items do not replenish upon resting at a shrine, and so, if you die a lot to bosses that require the use of said items, you will be forced to regularly leave the area and either farm up sen to buy more supplies, or to farm enemies and hope for the right items to drop. *Certain enemies and bosses take little posture damage, forcing a type of fight more similar to From Software’s previous titles. However, the vast majority of boss fights are designed for deflection style of combat. Death Death seems to be the most punishing out of all of From Software’s previous titles. You lose 50% of your carried sen and 50% of your progress towards your next skill point whenever you die. This is mostly par for the course considering their previous games. However, dying has consequences to the NPCs around you. More and more NPCs will eventually become sick as you die more often, halting their questline progressions until you cure them. Curing an NPC can be done, however, the cure is only temporary (if you continue dying, NPCs will get sick again), and the items required to create the cure are extremely limited (the wiki currently lists their total number at 8, but as the game is new still, there might be undiscovered merchants). If you mismanage your cure timings, cure too liberally, or simply die too much, you will lock yourself out of NPC questlines. Exploration Moving through the world feels great, with many hidden nooks and crannies, side paths and optional areas. The grappling hook adds fantastic verticality to nearly every place you visit, often allowing you to avoid a frontal approach and instead come in from behind or above and take out a bunch of enemies. The level design is top-notch. However, the joy of exploration is greatly stifled by the absence of real new weapons and armour pieces. 95% of all the loot you will ever find are coin pouches and consumables, the other 5% are new prosthetic tools and the rare item that upgrades your stats. Finding yet another ceramic shard that you can throw at enemies doesn’t feel exciting. Finding the latter feels rewarding, since those types of items tend to be guarded by tough opponents. The worst part is that, sometimes, tough enemies and even mini-bosses guard dead-ends with no interesting loot whatsoever. All in all, not being able to find new weapons or armour pieces puts a big damper on the joy of exploration. Skill System The game features a skill tree to upgrade Wolf with. With only two types of skill upgrades available, passives and special moves (of which you can only have 1 active), the skill system feels rather bare-bones. The prosthetic upgrading system has a lot of options, adding roughly 3 variations to each of Wolf’s prosthetic tools (of which you can only have 1 slotted per tool). It is unlikely that you will be able to fully unlock all skills nor all prosthetics unless you intend to do a heavy amount of grinding, and some materials needed to upgrade the prosthetic might be limited per playthrough. There is no real way to change up your playstyle. None of the passive or active skills or prosthetic upgrades alter the core playstyle in any meaningful way. Unlike their Demons’s/Dark Souls series, you won’t be able to customise your character to fit a certain playstyle. Bugs & Glitches I’ve run into these only rarely, but they do exist and most of them lead to the death of Wolf, resulting in you losing half of your sen and skill experience to no fault of your own. The jumping system is a bit of a mess and finicky to control. At times, Wolf will slide off of platforms, that, moments earlier you were able to jump on perfectly fine. When fighting enemies with big weapons on slopes, Wolf has been literally hammered “into the ground”, rendering him uncontrollable, stuck inside the level geometry and forcing a death or ALT+F4. Occasionally, the grappling system (especially the grapple-from-point-to-point version) flings you into directions that get you killed: like literally away from the next grapple point. Trying to jump onto certain objects can leave Wolf in an endless falling animation loop, with the only means of escape being ALT+F4, which could potentially lead to your save file becoming corrupted (the chance of actual save corruption should be highly unlikely, however). Like I wrote above, overall I do enjoy Sekiro but many of the design decisions have moved the game into a spot where I don’t feel I can rightly recommend the title to the “average” gamer, unlike their Souls series. This is mainly due to the intense damage you take from nearly everything in the game, and the requirement to sit down and absolutely learn attack patterns. In Dark Souls you had a good chance of beating a boss, even if it was your first encounter with it. With Sekiro, for every boss and miniboss I have fought, I needed a couple attempts to study and learn how to react to their move sets. At times I walked away and came back later, due to how tedious it is to repeatedly and slowly clear out miniboss arenas. This requirement to borderline perfectly learn a move set for every miniboss and boss you encounter and the requirement of mastery over so many enemies, I feel, is something that might turn average, less dedicated, gamers away from the title.",0.713696062564849854

Take Revenge. Restore Your Honor. Kill Ingeniously.",FromSoftware,Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,"Activision (Excluding Japan and Asia), FromSoftware (Japan), 方块游戏 (Asia)","I'm going to start out by saying that I am a huge fan of the Soulsborne series of games, and that has heavily colored both my expectations and judgements of Sekiro. Sekiro is a different beast, and while the Soulsborne DNA is quite evident, it remixes the elements it takes from the past games and uses them to create something that's innately distinct. My personal feeling is that Sekiro is worse for this, but many disagree, and they're not exactly wrong. It's different. That said, Sekiro is simply much less fun for me than any of the Soulsborne games. I've unlocked every ending, collected every item, completed all the questlines and bosses. I wanted to love Sekiro, as I love Dark Souls and Bloodborne, but after I'd checked everything off the list of things to do, I felt relieved and happy that I had no reason to play it any more, something that's never happened with any of the Soulsborne games. There is very little replayability in Sekiro, and once you've done everything... you've really done everything. In Dark Souls, you can play again with an entirely different style; the first time I played, I used a spear and shield almost exclusively, using armor that made rolls useless. Then I discarded the shield and armor, and grabbed a halberd for my next run, rolling as my only defense. Later I realized that the Great Scythe has an entirely different playstyle to most weapons, that certain weapons could be very useful in the offhand, that ultra greatswords were an enjoyable power trip, that rapiers were amazing counter tools... I've played Dark souls through many times over the years, always coming back and trying something new. In Sekiro, you get a katana. This katana has a light attack, a charged heavy stab, and a single combat art that can be equipped from a large variety. I've unlocked every combat art in the game, and despite there being about twenty of them, there's only three that are particularly good, and of those three, one of them is the best tool 70% of the time. You can change your combat art, but in general they're only useful for trivializing certain mooks, or countering certain boss attacks. With one arguable exception if spammed, they don't change how you play, they just make one or two moves easy to deal with. Prosthetics are a big deal whenever you hear about Sekiro, and you can equip three of them at once, which is nice, but broadly they have the same problem. The majority of the prosthetics that are available act as simple direct counters to enemies, a few of which are extremely difficult to fight unless you use the specific counter prosthetic. Many of them deal damage, but they're not fast or strong enough to be useful against bosses, and they're too expensive to use often against normal mooks. Two of them are extremely useful against bosses (with a few others occasionally being useful as specific counters), but both are barely more complex than ""Press button to get a couple free hits in."" There is just no depth to customization. Everything you fight, you will fight with a katana, and you will fight it in the one way that thing is fought. I find Sekiro deeply disappointing in terms of variety and lore. Almost all environments--except for one clearly inspired by a specific Lovecraft story--are deliberately mundane. The vast majority of enemies are some variation on a human with a normal weapon. There are very big humans with clubs, very small humans with knives, and hunched-over humans with large shuriken axe things, who are all about as visually nonhuman as an orc or gnome. They're all pretty similar to fight; be aggressive, constantly attack, stop only to block or parry their attacks when necessary. The bosses and minibosses also all largely follow this pattern of being human with a normal weapon. There are precisely three bosses which break the pattern as much as, say, Taurus Demon, the Bell Gargoyles, Capra Demon, Quelaag, Ceaseless Discharge, or the Iron Golem, and that's, uh, all the bosses in the first half of Dark Souls. Few of Sekiro's bosses feel like rehashes of a prior boss, but not many of them really feel original or exciting, either. You're just stabbing some uninteresting dude for no real reason beyond him being in your way, if even that. That leads into my last complaint. Sekiro is a story driven game, but its story just sucks. The protagonist is largely devoid of personality, the classic scowling stoic. There are four endings, only one of which has him taking an action without any prompting from somebody else, and despite that action breaking completely from the path of the story... it doesn't feel at all unbelievable for the protagonist to take it, because he's so flat. There are some interesting characters, but they're mundane, and with only hints of their greater stories being told. The game successfully made me curious about many things, and I did want to know more about the stories of several villains, but I was rarely rewarded with anything more than a couple sentences before they were forgotten about, a minor distraction on the endless path of aimless murder. There are major twists in the plot, but they feel senseless and random, without much more than the minimum foreshadowing, and even that only if you looked for it. Events broadly feel like they happen because the author felt like they were the best way to have some particular boss battle or encounter, not because it's what the depicted characters and world would result in. If Wolf is Sekiro's point of view character, Wolf is blind, or Sekiro is dumb. Personally, I think both are true. There is much more to say. The game is not small, and I could quibble about its elements and design choices for hours. It's not exactly a bad game--the posture system is excellent, for one, and I hope that it's somehow integrated into the next Soulsborne game. These, however, are my main problems, and they keep me from considering Sekiro to be a great game. It's just... decent, and that's disappointing.",0.706397473812103271

I think my biggest reason is the fact that when it came to Dark Souls, I always wanted to beat a very hard boss. Sometimes it would take a lot of time, but I always wanted to keep going and going for hours on end sometimes. When I did beat a boss, I felt accomplished and somewhat proud. I don't know why but I do not feel the same way in Sekiro, for some reason it just is not rewarding to me. I don't feel accomplished after beating a boss( or mini boss ) in Sekiro. I don't know why that is. I don't find it fun at all. Some people like the rock, paper, scissors type combat however it isn't for me I don't think. I will most likely get comments saying 'git gud' which is fair. I did find the game hard in some parts, as I did with Dark Souls but in this case, I had no motivation to overcome it like I did in Dark Souls. I don't think the difficulty drove me away from the game, more so the combat mechanics as a whole which sucks because the game looks great. If the mechanics were different and if I felt a sense of accomplishment after beating a boss, I honestly think I'd enjoy it. However if the mechanics were different it wouldn't be Sekiro then would it. The game seems to be fun to a lot of other people though and that is more important. You can't please everyone sadly. I do hope the best though for FromSoftware and hopefully maybe their next game will be the one for me, who knows.",0.685838401317596436

It's tightly-designed and extremely thoughtful in its implementation with a high gameplay skill ceiling. The game is punishingly difficult with very little in the way of shortcuts. The only way to progress is to learn the game and increase your skills. Your character doesn't get much stronger, you have to. Some people really enjoy that! I wasn't one of them and found Sekiro tedious after the midgame. Another tough miniboss, another back-and-forth samurai duel on the rooftop, another guy with a spear,.. You fought this boss, now fight it again with triple the health. There's no reason to replay the game because there's no different way to play, you'd just be doing the exact same thing again. If you like the gameplay, then this is a plus but for me it lacks the endless replayability of other FromSoft titles, plus you have to be Boring Gruffdude the whole time. It's an extremely well-designed, well-polished game that (for me) got boring and which I have no desire to play again, and certainly no desire to buy DLC for.

So much about it is perfect, including the handling of the character, the stealth mechanics, the new grapple system (which adds a whole new dimension of verticality to FromSoft's formula), the world and enemy design, and so many other things. But I think FromSoft took the difficulty too far with this one. Before you dismiss me as a casual and tell me to Git Gud, let me just say that I beat the game four days ago. Yes I finished the whole thing. And I enjoyed a lot of it, especially the stealth sections, which were implemented extremely well. But if I'm being honest, it feels like the balance between TOUGH and FAIR was completely thrown off this time. I'm an avid Souls fan; been playing those games since 2011 and I've loved every single one. They are tough as nails, but they always feel fair. Death is treated as a learning experience rather than a punishment, and if you're careful, you can almost always get your XP back after you die. If a boss is kicking your trash, you can grind smaller enemies for a while to level up. You can switch out armor, weapons, rings, buffs, and other stuff to see which strategy works best. Some bosses are easier to tank, some bosses require speed and precise dodging. But there's always a way to work around the problem. It's like a puzzle. If you try enough strategies, you'll eventually be victorious. And if worst comes to worst, you can always summon a friend to help. It's a tough series, but there's always a way to win, and that's what I love about Souls. Tough but fair, always. With Sekiro, every single benefit I just mentioned is gone. Every single one. If you die (and you will), you lose half your money immediately, along with your XP. There's a small, random chance that Unseen Aid will kick in and save your currency, but that chance starts at 30% and gets lower whenever you die. I was at 4% by the end of the game, and literally saw Unseen Aid twice in my last ten hours. There are no alternate weapons, there is no armor customization whatsoever, there's no grinding to level up, there's no summoning at all. There are no alternate strategies to beat a boss. You either deflect or you die. I got really good at deflecting, and sometimes it's incredibly fun and satisfying, and I would have happily played the game if that was the focus. But it isn't. Sekiro focuses on making the boss encounters as difficult as possible, in the most spammy, annoying way. The game teaches you deflecting and forces you to master it, but even if you do, the bosses are still almost impossible. They have ENORMOUS health pools, multiple phases, and most of them can one-shot you with no problem at all. Bosses can take upwards of 20 minutes, during which your gameplay has to be literally perfect, or you're dead. It never feels fun, it feels like a grind. I was so frustrated because my deflecting was so good, I mean I pretty much mastered it, but if I made one mistake 12 minutes into a fight, it was all over. Yes, you can resurrect. Yes, the bosses can hit you during your resurrect animation. Yes, the bosses can also resurrect, again and again. There was never a sense of accomplishment or elation after a tough boss fight. I just felt glad to be done and angry that it had wasted so much of my time. In particular, the last boss has four phases, all of them gruelingly difficult, and took me over a hundred tries to kill. It stopped being fun so long ago, and I just wanted to uninstall the game at that point. Rant over. The game isn't for me.

Sekiro is not a game most can just jump into, it takes a lot of time and focus to master the mechanics of the game. Personally I love the Souls games and From Software's design choices in their games. I have played Dark Souls 3 through and through, and I'm currently playing Demon's Souls daily on my PS5 at the time of writing this review. They are all fantastic games and offer a great challenge. Now I appreciate Sekiro and the differences it has compared to the Souls games (EDIT: It's not a Souls game, I thought this was apparent, but the comments on this review seem to have missed that point here). There is no denying that this is a fantastic game. The art style is great, the mechanics in game for the most part are extremely well designed and thought out, borrowing some of the best features from some of previous From Software titles, while innovating and bringing new features at the time. And the combat is very satisfying, with lots of very intricate details on how it handles. But the combat is also brutal. I think most Souls players can agree that Sekiro is a massive slap in the face, forcing you to forget some of your more rooted tactics and adapt to a much different combat system. Ultimately I think this is a really great side effect of the game, but it's sadly not for everyone. The amount of trial and error, focus, and self discipline it takes to start to master this game, or even get to a point where you can fight at a reasonable level, is astronomical. If you enjoy spending hours on one section, learning each and every mistake and pushing yourself to the point of mastery, you will likely enjoy Sekiro immensely. And that's not to say it will take hours for everyone. For some it might click instantly! But if you are like me, where it has not clicked instantly, and you use video games to escape stress and frustration at times, Sekiro might be too much for you, and that's okay. Sekiro is an incredible game and I want to enjoy it badly. But after playing a game for several hours and all I can get from it is frustration rather than satisfaction, I simply have to put it down. Writing this review is simply for me to try and help anyone who might be like me, who loves the Souls games and is interested in Sekiro, I would say just make sure you do your research first. It's very different from the Souls games and for some, that might be a good thing, providing a lot of good challenges and entertainment. But for others it may just supplement frustration and anger. TL;DR - If you don't like parrying/blocking in Souls games, you might not like Sekiro.",0.637975394725799561

It's a buy to play game, where you feel like in worst f2p if you dont subscribe to premium account, you will be ultimately drown in crafting meterials, which overflow your meager storage chest and overencumber you almost instantly. 2. You want to sell your junk, but there's a LIMIT on cash you can get per day shared between all vendors in game. 3. You constantly find a lot of legendary eq, which weights tons, but useless for you. You can sell them for lottery scrips for a (small) chance to win something more useful, and guess what? There is a LIMIT on those scrips you can get per day, so the burden drastically increases every day, if you play at least semi-actively. 4. There is a LIMIT on what you can build in your camp, but at least it increases with your leveling, so it's acceptable. But. You can build a good big house, with an underground personal vault... and all you can store there is one aforementioned meager chest. No, you can build tens of different-looking storage chests, but they all share that same meager storage space. 5. Cherry on top: there's a LIMIT on money you can keep on your character. And it is so small that no one will sell you something decent for money, nor there is a point for you to sell anything to another player. Everything nice comes via barter only on third-party internet resources. Should I mention that cash LIMIT overflows real fast? 6. There are other limits, like on total scrips or gold amount, but those can be managed, and not a problem to me at least for now. 7. There is no way by intended game means to transfer valuables between your characters. Yes, there are workarounds to do so, but they are unsafe, or require to use help from OTHER PLAYERS.

Explore a vast wasteland in this open-world multiplayer addition to the Fallout story.",Bethesda Game Studios,Fallout 76,Bethesda Softworks,"A few days ago I received an email from Bethesda customer service. It said that my Fallout 76 account had been suspended for cheating. They pasted in a couple of paragraphs from the code of conduct that said no use of third party cheating software was allowed. I have never used any third party software to cheat. I have never cheated or manipulated the game in any way. I have done nothing against the code of conduct that I agreed to. I tried to contact Bethesda or ZeniMax Media support. I found that there is no phone number to call. There is no online chat. There is no support forum. The only way to contact them is through email, which they only respond to about once a day. I found that the only way to contest the ban was to submit a ticket to customer service. When I tried to log on to my Bethesda account, It would not accept my password. I clicked on the “I forgot my password” link, which did nothing. I was not able to reset my password until the next day. When I finally got into my account I tried to submit a ticket to customer service to dispute the false accusation of cheating. I used the drop-down menu to choose “My account was hacked or suspended” for the subject field. I had to fill out an online form that had required fields. Many of the drop-down menus that I had to choose from did not fit the problem I was having and there was no way to choose other options. One of the required fields was “date of account creation” which I did not remember. The form would not submit until I filled out the required field. I had to put in information I know was not right just to submit the ticket. I put in the comment field that the date of account creation was wrong because I could not remember when it was created. I was frustrated and confused. Why would Bethesda accuse me of cheating when I had done nothing of the sort? I have been a huge Bethesda fan for years. I played Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4, and now Fallout 76. I waited patiently for Bethesda to resolve the problem that was obviously an error. I was sure that they would see the error and reinstate my Fallout 76 account. The first response I received from Bethesda support was an email telling me how to log on to my Bethesda account to find the date of account creation. This was the only thing in the ticket that they saw. They did not read the subject which said “My account was hacked or suspended”. I followed the instructions that they gave. It did not lead to information of when my account was created. I responded by saying that my problem was not that I could not remember when my account was created but that it was hacked or suspended. The second response from Bethesda support was a question asking me if there was another email I use because they said my email address on file was not associated with a suspended account. At this point I thought they were joking. I asked as much. There is clearly a ticket on my account that says “Account permanently suspended for cheating.” I gave them the ticket number. I pasted in a copy of the email they sent me saying my account was closed for cheating. I also included a screen shot of me trying to log into my Fallout 76 account and getting a message that says “Account not verified”. It is like the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. Finally, I received an email stating the following. “After a thorough review of your account, it has been determined that the account did in fact violate our Code of Conduct. We regret to inform you that your appeal for an account ban reversal is denied due to the evidence within our system for Cheating / Exploitation enabled via a third-party program. This account is no longer eligible to participate in Fallout 76 due to the offenses on this account. Due to the extent and scale of the violation, it has been decided that this account will remain ineligible to participate in Fallout 76 permanently. This decision was not made lightly, and it is final.” I maintain that I have never cheated. They never gave me a chance to defend myself. They never provided the evidence that I cheated. It seems as if they don't care if I am innocent or not. All I want to do is tell my story and find if there are other people who have been banned by Bethesda for no reason.

Explore a vast wasteland in this open-world multiplayer addition to the Fallout story.",Bethesda Game Studios,Fallout 76,Bethesda Softworks,"This is a great game. But I'm giving it a negative review for one reason: Not because it was a hot mess on release and it took Bethesda a year and a half to fix it with the Wastelanders update. Not because Bethesda insisted on only selling it for their own launcher in order to make as much money as possible (the Steam Store takes a cut). Not because of the Atomic Store, in which you can buy insanely overpriced cosmetics through micro-transactions (in a $40 game, yeah..) Not even because the Atomic Store also offers Repair and Scrap kits (i.e. NOT cosmetics) despite Pete Hines repeatedly promising players that the micro-transactions would be limited to cosmetic items. But because since release players have been requesting unlimited stash space for junk, and Bethesda have ignored this for more than a year only to offer a monthly subscription allowing you to pay $15 dollars a month for unlimited junk space. Since release the excuse for not giving players unlimited stash space for junk has been that it was not technically possible, that it would crash servers. Fallout 1st proves that that was bullsh*t. EDIT (~60h): I see a lot of people in the comments misunderstand the review. I'm not asking for unlimited stash space. I'm only asking for unlimited junk storage. EDIT 2 (~65h): I have subscribed to Fallout 1st. Let's see if this changes my perception of things. EDIT 3 (~120h): My perception of things has not changed a bit after 50+ hours with Fallout 1st. The scrap box should be free. Maybe even the tent (which serves as an extra camp with a stash and a scrap box, so you always can unload your items if you get overencumbered while exploring). The fact that I could not enjoy the game after 60 hours without Fallout 1st is bad. Really bad. No game should be like this.",0.938077270984649658

I've played all the games and loved them (Including questionable endings). But when Fallout 76 came out it was obvious from the beginning that Bethesda had done something very wrong so I avoided it like the plague. Until. A group of friends convinced me to play the new Wastelanders expansion. So we all gave it a go. But one by one the all gave up on it. Don't get me wrong it's a great game when you can actually play it. But to constantly be kicked off the servers especially in the middle of a long mission only to have to start it again and again (11 times is the record) is frustrating. I have tried. I really have (187Hrs). Because I really wanted to play out all the stories this game had to tell. But it has broken me today. I can't play for more than 5 minutes at a time and that's that. Disappointed with Bethesda but lately there seems to be a lot of that. It's seems to be all about the money now. Pay for a private world or pay to store more junk. They epitomise all that is wrong in gaming now.,0.929723381996154785

Explore a vast wasteland in this open-world multiplayer addition to the Fallout story.",Bethesda Game Studios,Fallout 76,Bethesda Softworks,"TL;DR at the end. I'm speaking purely through my experience with the game. I am not a reviewer or anything, this is my opinion and you might disagree and probably will. But opinions are opinions, if you enjoy Fallout 76, kudos to you, I love it when people are happy with their time spent on X or Y. If only Steam had a neutral score. It's what the game deservers. Is Fallout 76 a good Fallout game? No, far from it. Heck, I would say it's the worse Fallout experience out there. Even after almost 3 years, it's still kind of a mess. Gamebreaking bugs? Not that I have encountered, but lots and lots of other inconveniences, such as: frame drops, server issues, inventory management, clunky combat, missing items, getting out of bounds, player interactions, etc. Frame drops: What happens when you decide to use a singleplayer-focus engine and force it to handle multiplayer? Fallout 76 happens. This game is terribly optimized, even if you have the recommended requirements expect fps drops in some open world areas, combine that with clunky combat and you have one hell of a combination. Indoors instances are fine for the most part (looking at you daily ops). So if you look at the minimun requirements and believe it will run at 50'ish fps (obviously depending on your specs) you're wrong, it's probably 20-30, be prepared to struggle. If I have to dig into the game files to fix performance issues we are doing something wrong. Server Issues: Let's see: we have a good engine! Just a terrible choice for multiplayer I hope servers can at least be stable! And yes, for the most part they are. Sometimes enemies tp, sometimes you tp, sometimes it disconnects you just because, sometimes it can rewind your progress (granted it only happened once and it was just minutes of desync, didn't lose anything, just had to do a step on a quest again). It clearly struggles to keep up with everyone. Inventory Management: I will never understand how there's people out there that defend Bethesda for selling us a better stash. The vanilla stash has a total weight limit of 1200 ibs. Sounds like a lot? It's not, it might look like it at the start and you might go ¨pppfff this wont get full anytime soon¨ ooohhh but it will and when it does. It's hell. Welp, time to scrap/sell weapons/armor if you want to keep the sweet sweet junk with you. Even your character's weight limit is awful, even if you have max Strength, max carry weight perks, lower weight of X item perks. You're still gonna get overencumbered, your inventory will sit at a nice 249/250, just as an example. So it's about collecting junk until the limit, scrap it on your CAMP and repeat, or you would repeat if it weren't because your stash will eventually be full as I mentioned. Sometimes it even bugs and you become overencumbered when you're clearly not hitting the weight limit. Good luck fast traveling! Clunky combat: Combat in modern Fallout games has always been a mixed bagged, it's either good or meh at best. And here it's pure meh. Let me elaborate further; it plays like F4 or even F3 but it sure as hell doesn't feel as good. 60% of the guns in this game are just boring, you got your standard pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, gamma guns, laser guns, melee weapons, etc. They all feel plastic'ky, there's no weight, they sound boring. What I'm trying to get to is that they do not distinct from each other. It's just a bad gunplay overrall. What about the other 40%? It's actually really really good! When you start getting the late game guns it's a whole different experience----and that's also an issue. Difficulty in this game is everywhere, it's either hard just because or too easy oneshot everything'ish. And for some people, including me, that's just not engaging after the 12453th time. Weapons have durability, check, ammo management is there, check. While annoying as it is, it's Fallout after all. Sidenote: There's always a meta, there's always something that's on top of the food chain. And that's fine! But if that means some weapons are just not reliable at all *cough* bows *cough* why have them in the first place? Also give love to laser guns! Missing items: Honestly what's the point in grinding out gear just for it to have the slightest chance of dissapearing from your inventory forever? Well, I got that slightest chance. I lost legendary armor part of my build and a whole set of PA. Bethesda wont do anything about it and never will, believe in that, it's been an issue for a long time now. They'll just ignore your ticket and move on, because from their perspective you're a liar going out for free stuff. Some lucky people just log off and in for it to be fixed, some do and doesn't do anything, can you guess which one I was? Out of bounds: Okay, this is just a small thing that probably wont affect you but hear me out. As a fellow Vault Dweller Cannibal, it's so annoying eating your victims and *puuf* falling through the ground. It may not happen, but the chance of dying in the middle of nowhere and having to sprint like crazy for your loot is just annoying. Player Interactions: It's been an issue since launch and will always be an issue because of the game's core concept of an Online Open World Fallout Game. Simply put: Everyone is playing their Fallout adventure at the same time and they sure as hell are the protagonist. ¨But I'm a solo player, I don't care!¨ Then why are you playing an online Fallout game? You might as well go to New Vegas and have one hell of a ride there. Anyways, the world is just hugeeeeee and also empty. NPCs can't carry the emptiness, they'll just stand there and repeat the same two lines, and when you finally find somebody it usually goes like: X: *heart* Y: *heart* *leave* PVP players are only a 10% of the playerbase and they seen to have a bad time looking to 1v1 somebody else other than Dave level 750 over there. So if you're looking to do that, be prepared to struggle too. Maybe adding a whole PVP dedicated server would fix it, but Bethesda doesn't care about PVP, they did try with Nuclear Winter the Battle Royale mode but we all know how that turned out. It's not all negatives though, CAMPs are amazing! It's crazy what other people can do with such a limited builder and the best interactions with someone will happen on your or their CAMP. The community is friendly 90% of the time, so don't be afraid to salute a fellow dweller! But I still like you. Despite all that, I still like this game, but I cannot defend it at all, on the countrary I will give it all the hard love it needs just to be better. And that's about it, my main issues with F76, there's stuff I didn't talk about like seasons, or the terrible writting or quests in general. I also didn't mention the perk system, which makes the combat way more enjoyable once you get the hang of a build. TL;DR: Fallout 76, is it better now? Yes, 100%. Does that make it a good game? No, It's mediocre at best, if you have the reference of what a Fallout game has to have then you're probably gonna have lots of issues with it. Newcomers to Fallout in general should be fine but believe me when I say there's a better product out there. This game is the worse first impression you're gonna get of the franchise. Terrible inventory management, lackluster multiplayer experience, boring gun play, dumb difficulty scaling, performance issues and many others. Want to buy it? Wait for sale, it's not worth the full price tag, not even those Deluxe editions. And please don't support Fallout First, it's a joke (all though it's your money, don't listen to this crazy girl).

Explore a vast wasteland in this open-world multiplayer addition to the Fallout story.",Bethesda Game Studios,Fallout 76,Bethesda Softworks,"What if I told you that the endgame in Fallout 76 requires you to build a team of 4 and scatter about the map looking for 24 time sensitive encrypted key fragments. After finding them, you sit down together and decrypt a complicated and specific code that allows you to launch a nuclear missile onto the playable map. Feeling accomplished, your team gets together to assault one of the nuclear missile silos in an attempt to do your first launch. You spend a majority of your resources finding ways through this highly classified military facility and fighting off hordes of powerful robots. When you finally launch the nuke, it temporarily alters the playable map to a much crazier state. When you travel there, a giant boss appears. Already drained of most of your resources from clearing the silo, you fight with all you've got and scrape by to barely defeat the mighty enemy in time. You and your buddies claim awesome loot and talk about how you can't wait to do it again in a week or so after you've built up more materials. Doesn't that sound incredible? Amazing experience. Now this is what it's really like. You google the launch code because once someone completes it, it's the same code for everyone. Solo, you clip through the front door of the missile silo, which causes the game to not trigger any enemies, and immediately launch without fighting anything significant. The nuke lands and does nothing to the terrain except change the color of some plants. The boss spawns and you fire on it, but some random player with a hacked weapon kills it nearly instantly before you do enough damage, so you get no rewards. 10 minutes later you launch another nuke only to lag out in ground zero because enemies are endlessly spawning under the ground. You eventually kill the boss and get basic items that you could loot practically anywhere else in the world. This experience pretty much sums up the entire game. Fallout 76 was masterfully crafted... on the whiteboard. In execution it is frequently a catastrophe. If half the things in this game actually worked the way they intended, I feel like this would literally be one of the best games of all time. But because almost every experience is bastardized, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. I have sunken numerous hours into this game because I play video games 24/7. Please do not let my hours fool you into believing that this game is for you. I enjoy parts of Fallout 76, don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't expect anyone to overlook the issues I have outlined.",0.918155252933502197

Well, NO, and I am writing this review, to warn as many people as possible, so they wont pay for this broken software. Amount of positive reviews this game got now, is literaly incomprehensible. Especialy when we consider technical side of whole experience and how ugly this game is. The most positive thought in the context of Fallout 76 is that we should be glad, because Bethesda produces computer games and not, for example, software for respirators. Just imagine that vision of some parallel universe, where what I just said is a reality and everyday life, especially when we consider it's 2020 right now. We should all put our hands together in a prayer (you too atheists!), because in the end our lives are not in danger, only mental side of our health is somehow exposed, but in this case solution is simple - just don't buy Fallout 76, no matter how big discount is, no matter how much Todd Howard is waving at you, smiling, telling you that ""it just works"" and you should try it on your own. No, you shouldn't, because this whole thing is simply not working. I avoided Fallout 76 for a long time after it was first released, and I started playing it when it was launched on Steam. I got baited by positive reviews pretending game is now fixed, and it's safe to buy it. No, it's not and never will, because engine used to make this Fallout is simply too broken and too old to handle multiplayer game. There's a large pool of bugs and glitches, and Bethesda is pretending that they're fixing them, but in reality every single fix is bringing back old bugs. It's always the same scheme -> something is not working -> after two months (or even more) they apply fix (which break something else) -> week later new update break it to previous state for another two months -> then they release another fix... this circle never ends. You stuck in dialogue with NPC and can't progress your daily quest? Your turrets attack your own structures? Your perk/mutation is not working? Game is perma-freezing on loading screens and you have to restart it every 30 minutes? You lost progress because servers stability is a joke? Welcome in Fallout 76, where in endgame you will face bug every two minutes! I could make a very long list of bugs and other problems players face, but it would be just too long and it's hard to guess which bugs are active now, because like I said previously - Bethesda mastered bugs rotation in this game. Optimization in this game is just like everything else - how it work (when it work) is depending on various circumstances and changes every patch they apply. If you just made new character, and you run trough early game in 60fps, then in endgame you will have 30fps with regular stutters. It is like this, because amount of items you carry and store in stash directly affects your framerate, and to be honest I've never seen something that much broken in any other game. Fallout 76 in a nutshell. But let's talk about something positive this game has to offer, and in this case first thing coming to my mind, is community this game has. People are friendly and very helpful, they will explain everything you want to know, no matter how long it will take. They will craft gear for you, give you materials, help with quests, build structures you can't build on your own yet. But there is a dark shadow hiding behind all those friendly faces. I am talking about small group (but very loud) of players, fanatics, trolls and sect-like minority. To understand what I am talking about, you can just browse Steam forums of Fallout 76 for 5 minutes and you'll see it on your own. Why I am mentioning them? I am doing this only because Bethesda is doing nothing about problem, they are allowed to keep offending and attacking people who dared (how dare they?!?!) to criticize Bethesda. They'll keep striking on you and reporting your posts, and you might end up warned/banned for speaking your opinion in mannered way. Yes, Bethesda has their own ""freedom of speech"" standards, and it's very close to what you can face in People's Republic of China. Imagine you can build various items in your camp, and then you can use them to get buffs for your character. Great idea, right? In theory, yes, but you have to use each item for 40-50 seconds to recieve specific buff, so if you want to get all of them you waste 5 (!!!) minutes of your time, and one hour later you have to repeat whole process. Everytime you want to craft/repair/build you have to manualy change your perks loadout, which takes a lot of your time, and when you're done you have to manualy switch to your main build. Bethesda promised to implement perk loadouts system months ago, but it's not just about that. The thing is, that whole perk system lack any logic and common sense, because perks should be splitted into two categories - active and passive, and crafting ones should not steal slots. When you want to buff yourself using items from your inventory, you have to scroll trough whole menu to find them one by one. Every few quests/events, you have to do general cleaning of your inventory, because game keep throwing useless (and heavy) stuff at you as ""reward"". Every single system this game has is unintuitive, frustrating and not rewarding, and every simple thing you want to do takes ages to complete. At first it seems interesting, because you discover new places while hiking, do various quests, and simply enjoy it. But this phase ends pretty fast when you hit midgame, where grind begins and you realize how many limits this game has. In order to reach endgame you have to grind, everyday. How much you can store is limited, how big you camp can be is also limited, daily quests, daily currency gain, everything is made in a way to make sure you'll play game everyday to reach your daily cap, and make just a slight or no progress at all. Everything from events on map to daily quests is repetitive and boring. Game is designed in a way, where player feel hounded and forced to play everyday in order to reach daily limits, and if someone play everyday, that mean there's higher chance he will spend real cash to get additional stuff or to buy premium. Fallout 76 preys on basic human instincts, the desire to show off, being noticed, generaly speaking - need to be ""cool"" in other people eyes. Everything in this Fallout is built like a wall surrounding all these behaviours and feelings. They might tell you, that you don't need all that stuff, but believe me, you want it. That's how human brain works. Atomic shop is a masterpiece when it comes to psychological manipulation, fake feeling of items availability being ""limited"" by time, so you have to buy them before they're gone, discounts lasting for limited time, great deals for premium owners. Atomic shop, seasons, game mechanics, boring daily/weekly challenges, everything this game offers in the end has just one common goal - to make sure you're attached enough to play everyday, so at some point you might start thinking, that it wont be a crime if you spend additional money to make your in-game life easier and more colorful. I understand servers do not run on fresh air and companies want to earn money, and there's nothing wrong with that. But this is paid game, not some F2P title for android. It's also impostant to mention, that every new feature (like the newest thing available in game - shelters) is hiding 90% of new content and fun behind a paywall. Bethesda is literaly moving border to see how far they can go, and how much they can earn before this $ fountain dries up. In the end it's up to you what you'll do with your money, just think twice before you give them to Bethesda.",0.905997574329376221

Which is a shame because there's a LOT to love in 76 : It has the best map of the franchise, an amazing art direction, ton of loot and quest and everything but its all for nothing because once you get past level 30 unless you grind and pay that 1st sub, the game will constantly fight you. Want to play it like its Fo4 and just have fun exploring the wasteland and doing quests? Well once you hit level 30 most enemies turn into bullet sponges, your crafting become much, much more costly on ressources and at some point the main quest will straight up force you to grind events to progress. Basically once you hit level 30 and until at least level 50 when the level scalling stabilise the game go from a fun adventure in the Appalachian Wastelands to pure tedium and once you hit level 50 it show its true colors and turn into another MMO grind job with dailies and challenges and a pseudo battle pass and trust me there's much better MMO's than 76 out there.",0.901704668998718262

Just migrated my account to Steam. Massive review, but all the cuts for character limit don't do justice.

No issues after upgrading, but I still hear stories. = Being Reported will likely go nowhere, whether it is valid or not. = Character Customization is just okay. = Visioned as Rust close, now PVE fest Negatives - Bethesda listens to the wrong people and does the wrong thing. ""I don't like it when it tooo dawk"" - Beta player who doesn't play anymore * Makes nights too bright ""Wat if Atom Shawp was real place!"" - Reddit Galaxy brain who doesn't understand the amount of weekly work involved. * Plasters Cardboard Vaultboy Cutout Shortcut Everywhere - CAMP building could use less restrictions and more customization options. - Lack of End Game Content Only three events still exist that are intended for expert players, with the last one introduced two years ago. - No more vault raids. Expert event fumbled at launch. Instead of reworking it without the timer and adding a more appropriate boss, they dropped it entirely. Only remnant is a downsized version being used as an arena for Daily Ops. - Content is constantly delayed or canceled entirely. Major updates get delayed by a month or more. Four stars and improved pets silently dropped. Vaults dropped or downsized to empty smaller versions . NW was dropped with two unreleased maps. Completed presidential event dropped. Mole village and other areas dropped. Talks of PVP factions and survival competitions that never came to fruition. - New content is often short & unsatisfying. Majority of new quest lines that come out every 8 months (if we're lucky) can be completed in under an hour. Choices don't matter and only affect some dialogue. The Pitt/Expeditions is just Daily Ops all over again. Better armor/power armor was introduced, but the best weapons of the game are still ones from launch. - Legacy and Hacked Weapons If you are new and have a friend who can hook you up, move this into the positive. If not, witness players seemingly tear through end game content without effort. Legacy weapons mostly consist of explosive energy weapons that were removed from being dropped for being too powerful. However they were duped and thousands of them still exist in the game. There are also hacked weapons, weapons injected into the game that gave insane damage beyond intention. For a year, Bethesda refused to acknowledge these weapons even existed until the most common ones were disabled. - Bethesda has no social responsibility. They ignore problems, until it publicly becomes a problem. If you have a legitimate issue even when the decision is ""final and not made lightly"", complain on reddit and hope it gains traction. Otherwise, it will never get resolved. People who lost their equipment due to a glitch (Vault Raid Event) or something malicious (Equipment stealer) were initially told nothing could be done about it. Item Duplication via in game exploits ran wild for the first 3 months of launch with little to no disciplinary action... which of course just allowed the problem to spread with the assumption nothing would come of doing them. Instead of just wiping the characters and taking social responsibility, they banned a significant amount of people ""indefinitely"" and only unbanned them if they kept submitted support tickets about it months later. These duplicated items which include the best weapons still exist and continue to be given out freely or put on auction websites. Nuclear Winter, their battle royale had tons of potential. It was then attacked by hackers using sophisticated third party software on a daily basis. During this time, it was proven their support stopped responding to tickets (with evidence!!) about the issue. Often just marking them as ""Resolved"" so that they could no longer be escalated. The NW bans didn't come until reddit and other outlets took to it publicly. Many of these hackers persisted for weeks, even months before being banned. Most of which only got a 3 day ban (sounds pretty light compared to the indefinite ban), just to go out and do it again before getting a permanent one two weeks later. - Code of Conduct really means, ""Whatever we feel like"" Recently a player known as ""TopHatFetus"" who used the name since launch had their name forcibly changed to OpalPenguin2. Instead of leaving it at just that, they also said this would be a permanent violation despite never having done anything else in the past. This was likely done in response to recent US politics. When researching the issue further, it appears other players were unfairly given these violations and even three day bans. These names which are subjectively offensive at best included TwistingHips78 (claims to have been mass reported by a troll group), AbhorsenRaist (named after a famous fantasy book), and bclinton8 (His real name actually happened to be William Clinton), Jack-The_Stripper (Parody Name). ManyFaces88 and MommySalami managed to get their violations reversed after resorting to reddit. It can be assumed many more people were affected, but have gone on unreported. In a mature rated online game full of obscene material, a name like Bamboobzle (also banned) would be the least of my worries. I have also witnessed and reported legitimate harassment and racism with evidence, only for it to be ignored - Sinseer An infamous troll among the Fallout 76 PC community who had seemingly been banned from every major discord, facebook group and reddit. Footage still exists of this user engaging in extremely vulgar rants (on stream and in PUBLIC VOICE CHAT), using exploits, running two characters at once, using a voice disguiser, stalking and harassing other players. He also ran a website dedicated to name & shaming and even included players who had never even met him before. This individual for reasons unknown, managed to develop an open line with Bethesda in the form of phone calls and expedited support tickets for two years. Eventually the shenanigans got so far out of hand, they rightfully cut the relationship off and banned him. Of course, not before having amounted over 16,000 hours in the game. - InnovSurvivalist In contrast, this beloved and recognized youtuber who promotes the game in a positive light received a three day ban for ""griefing"". What happened you may ask? A group of trolls found a way to by pass pacifist and repeatedly destroy her camp. Getting annoyed, her husband got on the mic and let out a small vulgar line which the group mass reported. What happened to the griefers who exploited to instigate the scenario? Nothing. The game can be amazing for the first hundred hours or so, but there are likely better options if you want something that has a long term future and better support. I enjoyed my time, but the future is too grim to recommend.",0.888031601905822754

War Thunder is a game like no other, with a comprehensive damage system, combined arms, and variety of beautifully modeled tanks, aircraft and ships. Unfortunately, this ""uniqueness"" has left Gaijin with little real competition over the years. What started off as a ""free to play"" title has over time become less and less free. Gaijin keeps adding nations and vehicles, while at the same time increasing repair costs and lowering RP/SL gain. A premium account isn't enough to comfortably progress anymore, now you also have to buy premium vehicles in every nation. For the new players reading this, Gaijin has recently admitted that they balance free vehicles around a negative SL income for average players. That means they WANT you to lose money by playing, so you'll be forced to buy a top tier premium vehicle. This isn't just greedy, it also destroys the matchmaker and the balance of the game. Since you only profit using premium vehicles they often end up being spammed. In battlerating 8.7, more than half the players on each team are in premium tanks. This results in rampant ""one death leaving"". These players only spawn their premium tank and leave when it's destroyed, leaving their team in a bad position. Sometimes the premium is their only tank for the tier, othertimes it's because ""free"" tanks aren't worth the high cost to repair. Gaijin and their purposefully frustrating economy is ultimately to blame for this. There's so many other issues and scandals I could bring up, like how you can't repair or extinguish flames on your new tank before unlocking ""parts"" and ""FPE"". Gaijin wants you to pay gold to skip the grind for these essential tools. In it's current state, I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody. That might seem hypocritical considering my hours spent in this game, but believe me. It's new players who suffer the most. Gaijin doesn't care about me, you, or the playerbase. Don't make the same mistake as me. Find another game that values your input, and respects your time. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edit, July 26: Much has happened since May and the publishing of this review. Most importantly, on 13th of June, Gaijin published a roadmap of planned economy changes. Most recent roadmap update as of this edit: https://warthunder.com/en/news/8374-roadmap-following-the-roadmap-battle-pass-available-in-simulator-battles-en This was an unprecedented event, as we have never seen this much transparency from the Devs before. Despite tempered expecations and a healthy dose of skepticism on the part of myself and many others, the roadmap is actually progressing according to schedule. One of the key criticisms in my review, that of SL (Silver Lions) has been (largely) adressed, earnings were increased across the board, and repair costs adjusted. All ground vehicles now have a basic version of Parts and FPE available from the start without needing to unlock the Parts and FPE modifications: basic parts can repair components to partial functionality, while basic FPE is single-use. Aircraft with countermeasures now start with a basic flare loadout, while mixed / full countermeasure loadouts require unlocking the flare modification. You no longer have to pay repair cost when teamkilled (finally), and newly purchased premium vehicles now include 15 free backups (extra spawns). Backups are a consumable however, and as such it doesn't fully alleviate the ""one death leaving"" issue, as players will quickly spend their 15 backups and continue this behavior after. Gaijin needs to consider making the backup permament. I don't mean to diminish these changes, they were sorely needed, but there's still a long way to go. As of today, no changes have been made to RP (Research Point) gain, which is the main cause for slow progression, especially in Ground Forces Mode. The matchmaking system desperately needs a major overhaul, and battle ratings need to be decompressed. While matchmaking changes are mentioned in the roadmap, it remains to be seen how Gaijin chooses to handle this issue. All in all, while the changes are positive so far and show a lot of promise going forward, my review will stay unchanged until the roadmap is concluded, and the full effects can be seen. Lastly I want to thank you all so much for your attention and gracious awards! Thanks to you I have amassed just over 2.5 Million Steam Points! That's mind-boggling, I could've never anticipated this much engagement writing my little review back in May. I apologize for the late update, and let's hope for more good news.",0.989410519599914551

Basic explanation of the in game economy This ""game"", like many other free to play titles features an in game economy which includes a non premium ""Silver Lions"" and a premium (bought with real life money) ""Golden Eagles"" currency. These currencies are used to purchase in game vehicles and various other items, with the latter ""Golden Eagles"" currency used to by premium content which lets you speed up the grinding of new vehicles. While this all looks fine on paper, Gaijin, the creator of this ""game"", have been abusing economy for years now to milk as much money from its playerbase as possible. This is done by making the grind extremely difficult (especially at the stages with more modern vehicles) for players that have not spent any money on the ""game"". This difficulty then puts pressure on the free-to-play player base to spend money. And its only been getting worse. Very recently, Gaijin has released a patch that changed the economy and balancing of the game. These changes have made it even more difficult by forcing players to grind more vehicles (a good portion of which are often not fun to use) to reach the ones they are interested in playing. Another cruel change is the increase of repair costs, which is an amount of ""Silver Lions"" you need to pay in order to repair your vehicles and use them again after dying in them. This increase in cost means players have to earn more ""Silver Lions"" from their battles on average in order to profit, making the grind even less sustainable for free-to-play players. In fact, a staff member on the official WarThunder forum even stated that the grind was only designed to be profitable with premium vehicles/content. TLDR; The devs have, and will continue to ruin the game by being greedy and making as much money as possible off of the player base, do NOT play this garbage, it is NOT worth the time investment.",0.953234851360321045

I am a rank 100 and play all the factions. I also have been a very good customer of gaijin as I have bought a lot in their store over the years. And since I have invested so much time and money in it, I would like to give a positive review. But unfortunately I decided not to do that.... And also have decided to uninstall this game. At a given moment you are just done and all the trust is gone. It is a beautiful game but Devs are just the big problem. They prefer to make new content instead of fixing old problems. After so many years I have lost all confidence in them. They almost never listen to criticism from their fans and always think they know better. They forget that the fans want to improve the game with their criticism, but are often treated as Gaijin's enemy. There are so many problems that it is too long for a review but here is a list with the most important: 1. BR compression. Each vehicle has a battlerating like (1.0 1.3 1.7 2.0 ect). A battlerating is an indication of how good a vehicle is and what it can encounter. The maximum battlerating in a match can be +1 higher to -1 lower than your own vehicle. Which means that you can sit between the highest BR and the lowest BR (uptier and downtier). Now the vehicles are too close together in terms of BR, so compression. Which means that some vehicles dominate heavily and some do not have a chance at all when they come against each other in a match. Gaijin does not want to solve this problem because they want everyone to find a match quickly. (this is my biggest problem with this game) 2. Gaijin censorship, Gaijin does not like criticism. Post on their form that are critical and viewed by enough players just disappear. Gaijin denies, for example, that it was possible to cheat in their game. When a youtuber proved that it was possible. Gaijin wanted to copyright strike against this person or put the Realistich game mode to Arcade. As a kind of punishment for the player or something. I have no idea why.... Gaijin behaved rather childish. 3. Reporting a bug. During the years I reported all the bug that I found to gaijin. I have send replays and information. From 1000kg bombs that do no damage, tanks shot that disappeared in the air, to planes that were shot in 1/2 and keeps flying smoothly. I have seen everything over the years. Fortunately, there are never many bugs.... so that is good. But I have never received any answers from Gaijin. The only thing that is done is that your report gets closed, completely ignored or can no longer be found (disappears). It looks more like Gaijin sees you as a burden instead of help. There are many other problems in this game such as your tank shots that are absorbed into the Optics of the opponents tanks and do no damage or pay to win tanks like the is-6. But i have to stop to keep the review a little short, I close it here. Warthunder ""can"" become a much better game than it is now. There are too few players online to earn money so gaijin wants to pull as much money as they can from the remaining players as possible instead of recognizing problems and solving them.",0.948627471923828125

I get that it's confusing that I'm making a negative review. Tl;dr: This is a good game, but one of the worst, most scummy products I've ever seen. One that preys on people with addictive personalities in a wide spectrum of ways. All I really need to do is explain the monetization tbh: -Silver Lions: Silver lions are the non-premium currency for War Thunder. They are achieved passively just by played, and playing well gives a nice bonus. Winning matches massively multiplies silver lion gains (ie, if you kill 1 person in a match you lose in the planes mode you'll get a small amount of silver lions, but even just one kill in a match you win is worth a fair amount, and to a degree this gets better the better you play). But here's the... well... ""but"". Silver lions are precisely designed so that when you first start playing the game, no matter what (ie, whether you are completely free to play, just have a premium vehicle, or have premium vehicles and a premium account) you will be getting enough silver lions to more than cover the silver lion costs of the vehicles you will have access too. Low tier vehicles cost basically nothing to repair, as do almost all premiums (and premium accounts and vehicles both massively boost silver lion income while using them). You might be seeing the problem already, but if not stick with me here. As you progress through the game, if you're free to play you will at first quickly unlock cheap vehicles before reaching more expensive ones, then things will be slower and slower to unlock and more expensive. To be clear, all of this so far isn't a big deal. The issue comes when you reach about 7.0 (battle rating, which is basically just a ""level"" for matchmaking balance) for ground forces or about 8.0 for air forces, in my experience. At this point vehicles are sluggish to unlock and extremely expensive. Buying them, training a crew slot to play them, and every modification all costs SL, but also repairing and rearming the aircraft after the battle. At the lower tiers you might not even notice this. By about 6.0 you'll almost certainly notice this but unless you play very poorly it won't be a major issue. You might have to take it easy right after buying a newly unlocked vehicle, but other than that you're fine. But beyond that, certain vehicles (seemingly arbitrarily, though there's always a long winded explanation that boils down to ""balance"") cost bafflingly, ridiculously, hilariously high amounts of silver lions. If you have about 2-3 million silver lions at lower tiers, you're golden. You can lose some of it if you have some rough matches, but you'll be fine. At the higher tiers, you could burn through that in a day just by being unlucky. Half the time you unlock a new jet or main battle tank it's so expensive you either can't buy it, or can but then can't play it because if you die before getting a kill you lose massive amounts. So the question is... why? Why is there vehicles in the game that you are punished for playing? Why is the game designed in such a way that you can progress by grinding for hundreds of hours only to be rewarded by being literally unable to play if you have some rough matches? Well, it sorta brings us to the next monetization, but basically, you can buy Silver lions for real money. If you run out you can pay for more. Now full transparency, this isn't technically pay-to-play. It's more like ""pay-to-easily-play-high-tier"". You're not locked out of playing the game, but if you really want to play high tier modern stuff and don't have silver lions, you're out of luck unless you have amazing matches. Certain vehicles, like the B-29/Tu-4 long range bomber have such a high repair cost, and such a low survival rate that they are essentially useless. Gaijin balances almost exclusively through SL costs. It's awful. So, next up is Golden Eagles. This is the premium currency. This is nothing new, every F2P game has them pretty much. It's not something I would review a game as negative for normally but Golden Eagles are a small piece of the puzzle. They can be used to buy the majority of the premium vehicles in the game, as well as silver lions, premium account time, decals, decorations, ect. Premium vehicles are often unbalanced on launch but get balanced overtime. I don't know if this is intentional or not but after the IS-6 dominated for over a year Gaijin has toned this down a lot. Still, some are better than others. They're objectively not pay to win, but they are clearly pay to progress. The biggest issue is that new players can pay about the price of a full AAA game for a high-tier vehicle without learning how to use it. The game is loosely designed in such a way so that as you progress you learn the skills you need to progress. It's not super linear but it naturally happens fairly well. But if you can just buy the highest tier stuff with no limitations then you skip the grind, yes, but you also skip the learning. This leads to a lot of very inexperienced players at high tier, who often teamkill, ram, block, capture-point steal, and otherwise ruin the game for what should be the most dedicated part of the playerbase. To be clear I'm not strictly against this but there's already so little incentive for team-play in this game that new players with high tier premiums are never actually gonna put in the time to learn how to play like experienced players do. Again, fine, but it's two clashing playstyles that shouldn't ever really meet. Jets and main battle tanks should, in theory, have the most depth and highest skill ceiling in the game but through a mix of map design, mechanics and this aforementioned premium issue, they actually have the least depth aside from the very lowest tiers, and devolve into head-on ramming and head on charges. Premium accounts. Not much to say here. Again, normal for F2P games, but on top of everything above, and everything below, it's a lot. They basically make it so you get more research and silver lions. You progress faster and run out of lions slower. It effects other players in no way, since even if you have a premium account, unless you buy a high tier premium, by the time you get to high tier you'll likely be fairly experienced. Convertible Research. One of the scummiest. Basically you can pay Golden Eagles (real money) to speed up or skip the research of a vehicle. This one just purely prays on frustrated people not thinking clearly who are fed up with the grind. And this game is full to the brim with grind. It is literally endless grind. You will never achieve everything without paying huge sums of real money, but the game loves to tempt you with the fact it's technically possible (until they add the next thing, and they add new vehicles every update more or less). Never, ever ***EVER*** use convertible research unless you have some golden eagles laying around and a bit of research you don't feel like doing. Even then it makes more economic sense to just get premium (vehicles or account). This is a waste of money. Do not use your eagles on this. Gaijincoin and the War Thunder Market. Think of the CS:GO or Dota or TF2 marketplaces. It's just that. Turn your money into even faker money which you can't turn back into ""real"" money. There's skins and non-premium but exclusive vehicles on the marketplace. Almost all are event vehicles that required immense grind to get. A few of them are outright overpowered, like the KV-220, and thus go for hundreds and hundreds of dollars. A lot of the cheap skins on here are great though and a portion of the money goes to the artist so it's not the worst thing ever. You can get some of this stuff for free easily. Again, this isn't on its own that big of a deal, but keep in your mind that all of this is in *one* game. There's also a battlepass (Like Dota, Overwatch, Smite ect.). Basically: Every element of this game is designed to squeeze money out of you.",0.946997165679931641

Disclaimer: This is a list compiled by u/agysykedyke on Reddit. It aggregates and summarises the abhorrently antagonistic and hostile behaviour Gaijin has shown their community and players throughout the years. This is but a fraction of the malevolence characteristic of this company. Addendum: My total hours played on Steam are not representative of how long I've spent in War Thunder. I've been playing this game since the beta and have played it on multiple platforms throughout the last ten years with much of it being played through Gaijin's own launcher. After having been disgusted and physically repulsed by Gaijin's treatment of their community over the last two years, I've decided that enough was enough. I have watched this game deteriorate and it is no longer the game that I once enjoyed and hoped would become a maverick of its genre. It exists only as a tragedy of what could have been. In light of the new awful economy changes, I have compiled a list of all the scummy things Gaijin does which worsen the experience for all players, in the name of profit only. I really hope they change some of these things for the better. [*]Intentionally releasing new vehicles in an overpowered state in order to make people grind as quickly as they can to abuse them before the nerfs. [*]Intentionally releasing overpowered premium vehicles and not nerfing them, in order to make people purchase them. [*]The price of said premiums being equal to triple-A games. I don't know how it's excusable for some premiums to be $70 when they already sell premium accounts for $10 a month. [*]Intentionally making SL modifiers low and repair costs high, so that the average player cannot break even in SL after a game. This encourages them to purchase a premium account or a premium vehicle. This also encourages players to leave after one death to minimize losses. [*]Implementing research efficiency and tiers to make players buy more than one premium per nation in order to grind. Keep in mind each premium can cost up to $70. [*]Forcing players to buy a vehicle previous to the one they want to buy, regardless if they ever want to use it. A lot of vehicles should be in a folder but are not, because Gaijin wants you to spend more SL. [*]Forcing players to buy X vehicles from the previous tier before they can buy vehicles in the next tier. This increases the grind and forces you to buy vehicles that you might never have any intention of playing. [*]Still making the SL and RP grind painfully slow even if you are using Premium vehicles and a Premium account, especially at the top tiers. Mind you you are paying $10/month + the price of 2-3 premiums per nation you want to grind and it's still very slow. [*]Intentionally making stock vehicle performance extremely insufferable by locking away essential needs such as Spare Parts, FPE, NVD, usable ammo, and countermeasures. This is to make players purchase these modifications with GE. [*]Introducing crew qualifications, which are arguably a pay-to-win feature. Aced crews provide significant advantages over basic. The SL cost for expert crews and the grind for Ace crews are not viable for the average player, people just purchase Ace crews. [*]Putting players in debt over their own mistake after the January 2022 incident. They could have just let those players keep their 7 days of premium as a New Year's gift and take the good publicity but they doubled down. This was so bad that some players were going to take legal action because they felt as if they got scammed, and Gaijin was forced to remove the debt because of the insane backlash. [*]Selling pay-to-win bush cosmetics, which otherwise are extremely hard to grind for, are unavailable for half the year, and you only get one random bush. [*]Implementing an RP soft cap, which punishes skillful players because otherwise they would grind too quickly and won't be compelled to spend money. [*]Introducing strike drones, to make the game more frustrating and to make people lose SL. If you get 2 kills and then die with your drone it will be less SL earned than the repair costs of what you killed due to the modifiers, a net negative overall. [*]Intentionally making one nation overpowered, then making a different nation overpowered in order to make players purchase premiums to grind the new overpowered nation. [*]Intentionally keeping the BR's compressed in order to make the game more random and frustrating, to limit skillful players, and make players more likely to spend GE on mods, crews or premiums. [*]Intentionally making minor nations have underpowered vehicles with very high repair costs and low modifiers, because they are played by mostly experienced players who would otherwise grind too quickly. [*]Making Boosters expire for no reason other than to take advantage of FOMO [*]Slashing the economy time after time but disguising it as a net positive. For example, making the players ""choose"", but nerfing the economy either way and putting the blame on the players. [*]Introducing extremely grindy events with vehicles that never return, or are sometimes OP, capitalizing on FOMO. [*]Introducing lootbox-style crates bought for GE, or ridiculous amounts of SL, with very low chances of getting the reward you want. This is effectively gambling at worst and very predatory at best. They do not need to be this aggressive when it comes to monetization. This game already makes so much, I just hope they start caring more about their player base and less about their profits. The collective anger and frustration felt by not only myself but the community at large cannot adequately be expressed in writing, but we shall still make the attempt. Any prospective players beware, you will be actively punished and penalised for playing this game and not giving your money over to Gaijin. I have seen the community take action before, but I truly hope that this marks a period of reckoning and penance for Gaijin's actions against us.",0.943001925945281982

Let me list the most frustrating aspects of this game: A bit of a lengthy review but if you are really interested in this game then you should at least skim this review to get an idea of what you're signing up for. Also the first serious review I've done of a game but I have been playing this for 4 years now and it's about time I told (warned) people about it. The devs: Has never listened to it's community's suggestions or bug reports. The closest we ever got was when everyone, including the largest Youtuber Phlydaily was pushing to have parts and fire extinguishers to come for free with every vehicle, instead of making it a module to research (or spend money on). So if you get shot in the transmission, yup you cant move the rest of the match, or get shot in the barrel? Yup, you are completely useless unless you can make it to a cap point which sometimes there is only 1. Guess what... they said ""no"" and have since never acknowledged community suggestions since then due to the horrible PR fallout. They balance the game based off players stats in that particular vehicle. Leaving some vehicles completely broken or overpowered for months while data comes in for them to actually do something about it. Easily the most frustrating of these cases was the fact that the battle rating spread is so compressed from power creep that they couldn't figure out what level to put the Maus at to make it competitive and balanced so they just removed it from the game. LOL yeah they barred new players from being able to research it cause they were too lazy to fix their game. They also will gladly make up stats or armor values about tanks to fit their view of what they think it should be capable of. The grind: dear god the insane grind, if you don't get premium AND a high tier premium vehicle ($80 for a year of premium time and $40-$60 a piece for the vehicles, some of which are also broken - STRV 103-0 - to name one) then it will literally take you 6-12 months to grind out a single nation. So if you are strapped on time to dedicate to gaming, then just pick a nation and stick to it or you won't see anything past tier 3-4 (early world war 2 armored vehicles). It will easily take you a year or more to grind out the top tier jets/tanks of any nation. New vehicles: Anytime they add a new vehicle or whole nation, which is all the major updates contribute to the game, they generally make it overpowered so people will spend money on getting the ""op vehicles."" The other portion of new vehicles have some extremely frustrating broken/missing feature that they don't address for months and in most cases years after it being well known to the community. The maps: Only 6/38 have protected spawn points, leaving you open to being sniped (sometimes from the enemy spawn) 15 seconds after spawning. There are countless ""unintended"" spots that completely break the map allowing you to see the entire battlefield while also being immune to fire if you have a strong turret (they tried to fix this but failed.) Horrible design flaws continue with layouts that, in combination with game modes, make tanks designed for hull down and defensive game play completely worthless because you HAVE to push to the objective to cap and win. Oh that's right there is 1 single type of game mode: domination, where you have to push to the middle of the map and cap a point, sometimes there's 1 2 or 3. Yup that's all we get for variation in game play across all types (sim/realistic/arcade). Also since they added thermal sights and night vision devices, every 10th game you get is a night battle. Ya and it can take a week or two w/o premium time to grind out the modules that allow for this. Especially for night battles but also generally most people just leave the match after 1 death. This is only a problem for the higher tiers though, made worse by top tier premiums making for many players to not have lineups to have a proper ability to fight and finish a match. The worst offenses for Gaijin's inability to make viable maps is that they give you city maps that measure 1km from your spawn to enemy spawn in modern MBT's... As well as very poorly thought out maps that encourage players to go straight to the enemy spawn and spawn camp instead of trying to navigate/fight in their confusing layouts that make no sense from a gameplay perspective but ""are accurate to a real life location."" Helicopters: Two words- completely broken. Damage models allow for a helicopter to shrug off 120mm APFSDS rounds through the entire length of the heli unless you precisely hit the pilot, and a lot of the time immune to even direct hits from SAMs and ATGMs. Even hitting the engine and causing a fire won't cause it to crash; only gently begin losing altitude all the while spamming hydra rockets at you, which auto-kill you if you're in a light tank/anti-aircraft. They don't even have their own (functioning) game mode meaning you're forced to use them in ground battles to grind out the later heli's. Which by-the-way require an EXTREME amount of grinding to get to the top of the line, OR as the developers likely intended: just buy your way to. For example, I'm grinding the German line with the BO 105 CB-2: I have 50 kills and 32 battles in a PREMIUM heli with premium time and I'm not even a 5th of the way through the first heli to research. 40k/170k RP (research points) and then there's 3 more after that (requiring an additional 1.2 MILLION RP+4 million silver lions) when you finally get the most OP/actually good heli for Germany. which gets 8 fire and forget missiles that allow you to raze entire flanks/teams within a minute if left unchecked. Did I mention only about a third of battles in ground mode actually will net you enough spawn points to even take one out with AGMs and not just dumb fire rockets. This coupled with the aforementioned horrible map designs, leading to many many games being throwaways, make it nearly impossible without spending money to achieve the top tier heli's. Air realistic battles: have 1 single game mode variant and it hasn't changed at all since it's introduction to the game back in 2011. It's fun but it takes 1-5 minutes in loading queue to find a game then it takes anywhere from 3-6 more minutes to actually see combat. Also it doesn't really have any use for bombers of any kind, AKA they are irrelevant to winning the game except for literally 2 bombers in the whole game that can actually win the match if they're ignored - B-29 and TU-4. You can't respawn either in this mode so if you spent 7-10 minutes climbing to altitude trying to catch a bomber, only to have them shoot you in the engine then guess what: you have to fly back to your airfield and repair and if the match ends by the time you are capable again you receive nothing for your effort. At which point you just spent 20 minutes waiting for a game, then just flying around climbing/running/cursing. It reminds me of good old Battlefield 2/3 when there was mass war with helis/planes and tanks all duking it out for victory. Game modes: Realistic mode, a majority of players -including myself- play this, there aren't enemy markers unless they are hit with any type of munition, which pings a red icon on the mini-map. No assist to aiming and allows for sneaky plays at the cost of also being chop liver for aircraft which are constantly a headache and only require 2-3 kills. AA is cheap to respawn in but some nations get excellent AA while others don't even have any for certain BR's (battle ratings). A massive problem with aircraft being so easily available is the all too common revenge bombing, usually involving the enemy just flying directly into the ground on top of you dropping their bombs a second before death - usually also having enough points again to spawn into a light/medium tank again. I wish I could have my 2000 hours and countless dollars back.",0.935781717300415039

Bugs and bad features go unaddressed for years, while Gaijin add drones, pointless entrenching tools, and now redundant slowed bombs (there is already a timed fuse if you want). Despite tons of feedback expressing the communities hatred of stats based balance and rewards, the devs pretend not to hear. We all know the game needs to make money. But rather than make money by making the game good, Gaijin seems determined to make it painful instead. I would prefer a subscription based model over a F2P. But THIS particular F2P model is just terrible, and getting worse. I can't recommend, despite my many many hours in it.

Whether on premium currency, buying vehicle packs from the online store or buying premium time. At the time of writing this review I have 240ish days left of Premium time left. I started playing just before they released Ground Forces. The game started out very fun and engaging, but now 1500 hours later I see the game for what Gaijin have turned it into. They turned a fun game, albeit with a heavy dose of grinding, into one of the least fun games I have played in a long time. Pros: 1. It looks great when maxed out graphically. 2. The variety of vehicles is amazing. (caveat about this later). There are manyt different nations to play as. 3. Netcode, while not the best I've seen, is very passable for a Free to Play title, with only minor hiccups throughout my time. 4. Bugs and glitches, they definitely exist but they did not hinder my gameplay to the point where I would complain about them. 5. Cross play with either Xbox or PS4, but not with both simultaneously. Cons: 1. Economy, whether for Silver Lions (SL) to purchase things you've unlocked, or Research Points (RP) to actually unlock them, is a slog. It has been only getting worse as time goes by. It can take ages to unlock the ability to purchase a new vehicle(topping out at just shy of 400 thousand RP), let alone have the Silver to actually purchase the vehicle (upwards of 2 million) and then pay to put a crew in the vehicle (2-3 hundred thousand). Keeping in mind, without paying for premium account, you may only get 500-1500 RP and 10-20 thousand SL per match, which can take anywhere from 5-35 minutes. 2. Premium currency is very expensive, and some of the best and most unique vehicles can only be obtained by purchasing Gaijins premium currency, Golden Eagles(GE). There are alternate ways to getting it besides buying it, as I have heard that certain apps will allow you to accumulate GE over time, but I did not use them myself. There is a secondary currency that they use called Gaijin coins that are 1:1 with USD, which is used in the marketplace they created. 3. The Marketplace. I hate it. Vehicles sell for hundreds or thousands of dollars, it completely changed the way the game felt once it was introduced. It's just like CS:GO skins, only its not just skins. Imagine if you had to buy the AK-47 in CS:GO for $700 before you could use it. 4. The balancing is probably the worst offender in the reason for this review. Gaijin has shown over the years that they do not intend to balance the game, going so far as planning on removing vehicles because they would be to hard to think of a way to balance them. Standard M.O. for Gaijin is to release one or two shiny new vehicles that are overpowered for one to two out of the seven in game nations, wait for everyone to spend money getting to those vehicles and then once the novelty has worn off for players, do it again. It is never a level playing field for every nation. One country gets something that completely outclasses every other nation, every patch. I'm tired of it and its not fun. I could absolutely write more about the game, but I really don't want to give it any more time. Can you have fun with this game? Yeah, sure, but you probably used to play with dirt when you were a kid and thought it was great too. Final Rating: Just watch a Youtube WW2 documentary / 10",0.922902584075927734

After playing the game a little I wish I could give it a neutral review, but as of the current direction the game is taking I will leave it as a negative one. The game itself is fun. It's free, so try for yourself. The main issues the game has begin showing once you reach the endgame grind. e.g. Tier V+. The grind has been getting worse and worse, especially without a premium account and vehicles. Not only in research, but also in purchase and running costs. Gaijin attempts to balance things by increasing repair costs, which does not really change the balance, but just makes it impossible to play certain vehicles, such as Bombers, for prolonged periods of time with any sort of profit. As a 100% free player, if the unlocking of vehicles doesn't bring you to a halt, then making enough money to actually play them will do the trick. It's quite a shame because under all the grinding and money sinks, War Thunder is a fun game that has taken a turn in the wrong direction. Not into a Pay 2 Win, but in a painfully slow grindfest which fails to reward players properly for their performance in matches. The worst offender in recent years though, has been the Gaijin market. What started out as a neat little idea similiar to the Steam Marketplace, the gaijin market moved away from a community content driven store, where players could sell their vehicle camos and profit, to a more intrusive model, selling parts for construction events and trying to squeeze as much money out of it as possible.

(Jan, 5 2013) When i first started playing i was in love. It was the only thing I ever did all day. The thought of getting to jet drove me to play for 14 hours at a time. The game was great. Then the updates started to come... At first it was just harder to make money and xp. People hated it but I kind of liked it. Then the BR system came and balance left. Matchmaking had trouble getting fair matches but even that wasnt so bad. Then the russian bias got real. Im not one of those people that complain that I died to X russian plane/tank but after seeing russian tanks and planes survive things that would destroy any other tank it got annoying. (planes putting out fires, t-34s bouncing tiger 2 shots in the side, ext) But even this wasnt what made me quit this game. It's the company. They are absolutly terrible. Constantly censoring anyone with an opinion than dosent match theirs. They threaten to ruin RB if we dont let them attack youtubers that help them by finding cheaters? And even steam isn't safe. They constantly have people downvote any review that is negative. I can forgive russian bias. I can forgive the terrible BR system. I cannot forgive this company for the way they treat their community. To Anton Yudintsev, you made a game that was amazing. I loved it so much and always will. But what you have become as a company will destroy you in the end. Listen to the community, let them help you make the game better.

At its core warthunder is a good game, decently well made. but what truly lets Warthunder down is its developers Gaijin is the definition of lie cheat and steal, they do not listen to the players unless they do something so stupid that the whole playerbase revolts, like when they tried to add p2w repairs and boosts for your vehicles. they removed the maus with a nonsense excuse that it was ""too hard to balance"" when really they just wanted to make it and event vehicle to make money off people that want it. they seed old vehicles that you can no longer get to players in lootboxes that you buy with real money from their rip off Great Value TF2/CSGO marketplace where those vehicles litterally sell for THOUSANDS of real life dollars they can't be bothered to maintain their game at all, there are still bugs in this game from when it launched like 8 year ago, they make players write a fucking essay on the bug for them to MAYBE pay attention to it because none of them even play the game, so they would not know. i have NEVER seen worse spawnkilling in a game. ever, ever ever ever. people target the spawn first because its legal with no punishment. no ""keep out"" zone, 10 seconds of spawn protection for tanks. the prices for premium vehicles are way too much, 60 dollars for a top tier premium (yes they sell top tier premiums) is a little much man, not to mention thaat if you want to progress in any semblance to a reasonable time you MUST HAVE Premium time. don't let them lure you in with that shiny Abrams or that nice Apache or that sick F-4 Phantom II because unless you are willing to spend a 1000 hours of your life or open your wallet then you won't get them, infact you wont even get close, about a little under 1 percent of players that start warthunder will reach those vehicles, because you need millions of total rp (research points) to get them, and when you get 2000 rp a game... well you see where this is going. honestly the only reason i have played this game so long is because all my friends play it and its all my potato laptop can run no review has ever been close to describing all the problems with warthunder and this one won't either. don't even bother as long as gaijin runs the show ~ Drakebling",0.913305282592773438

The issues in the game and flaws are a result of the developers ignoring user reported issues on quality of life, bugs and inaccuracies in the physics engine and vehicles. It really gives the impression that the developers are not interested in the long term health of this game and keeping its community happy. The game suffers even more because it is dominated by an excessive grind to the point where it is expected to spend thousands of dollars to realistically proceed to just a handful of vehicles in the upper ranks (of which there are thousands of vehicles). Even with recent improvements to the economy, the game is still unenjoyable because the rating system of vehicles is poorly designed so that similarly ranked vehicles have massive gaps in power and capabilities. The game feels rigged rather than competitive. This is not the case because it is a free-to-play, pay-to-win model- usually new players buy high ranked premiums and then get destroyed because they have no idea what they are doing. This is because Gaijin is ultimately not concerned with balancing vehicles across nations, allowing certain vehicles at certain ratings to have win rates FAR above 50%. TLDR; mistreatment of community, excessive grind, poorly optimized competitive system Update: The community's feedback has led to some improvements in the game's economy, which is a positive step forward. It's notable that community engagement played a role in this progress. Regarding some discussions in this context, I'd like to clarify my viewpoint. While there have been concerns about potential pay-to-win dynamics, it's important to highlight that skill and experience largely determine success in battles. Pay to win is not the issue at all, but it is primarily seen as the main issue, which is a problem in of itself. It's clear that newcomers who acquire new vehicles might face challenges initially, as learning curves are part of the experience. However, it's worth noting that the primary concern, in my opinion, revolves around the effectiveness of the rating system for vehicles competing against one another. Additionally, new players acquiring vehicles and encountering difficulties, which sometimes lead to early game exits, can result in team imbalances. Addressing these issues could lead to a more balanced and enjoyable gameplay experience for all users. Constructive discussions about the game are valuable for its growth and improvement. While some dedicated players might have invested substantial time and resources, diverse opinions contribute to a healthier gaming environment. It's natural that criticism may arise from different perspectives, and it's essential to consider varied viewpoints for the betterment of the game. As someone who has also spent a significant amount of time playing, I understand the passion and attachment to the game. It's evident that the game has the potential for enjoyment, but there is room for refinement in areas such as gameplay variety and community engagement to enhance the overall experience.",0.912077784538269043

Requires Forza Horizon 5 game, expansion sold separately.",Playground Games,Forza Horizon 5,Xbox Game Studios,"I feel a bit mixed about this game, I'll pretense it by saying that I love this game, its fun and feels great to play - and was my introduction to the Forza series... However, something always felt off, and now that i've played some of the prior games, I feel like I know what it is. (I'll be comparing it to the previous title mostly as its the only one you can still buy on steam - idk for how much longer though) Graphics - One of the first things you'll notice is the graphics, they are impressive - if you have a machine capable of running it at max settings... Theres been no care into the lower visual settings, and that shows greatly on my system, I have a 1000 series GPU, Forza Horizon 4 looks GORGEOUS on it, and runs extremely well on the max settings, the cars & weather look stunning & every season is distinctly different in terms of colour balance. Whereas in this game, anything lower than High looks like a game fresh out the Xbox 360 era with just more polygons. Cars look almost like stickers on the screen, and weather effects look awful & can be really distracting while you're trying not to be wrecked by the AI. Forza Horizon 5 on Medium Quality... Looks worse than Forza Horizon 4 on Medium Quality (and runs a lot worse), and I dont believe there is an excuse for that Story - if you could even call it that is uninteresting, completely uninspired & an absolute pain to get through. The dialogue is not entertaining at all, and often times just feels depressing to sit through. I dont even know how they managed to screw up the welsh drifty boi's dialogue, but it just wasn't as memorable as his appearance in FH4. Theres a distinct lack of interesting stories to do, and it feels like a very missed opportunity to showcase the unique environment of Mexico & its culture around cars. The Vocho story is a great example of what they couldve done, but instead that is the only story that focuses on Mexican car culture. FH4 has lots of memorable characters, each story felt distinct & THE BUSINESSES, OH MY GOD THE BUSINESSES - those are fun. This game does NOT have businesses, which were where a fair bit of my FH4 fun came from, an odd choice - and thats kinda what describes a lot of this games decisions... Odd. Car Selection - Great, but theres yet another odd choice in how its handled. Both Fiat/Abarth & Alfa Romeo are still missing even though it has been almost a year since the game has released, and despite massive amounts of asking from the community. Theres a distinct lack of unique American cars, brands like Saturn or Scion (both defunct im aware) are missing, theres a serious lack of saloons or other Consumer ""i can get this"" cars, Theres only 2 Cadillacs, 3 Pontiacs, 1 Oldsmobile (its a cool one, but still), and very few cars that would actually be common in Mexico... BUT there are ~60 Fords & ~50 Porsches, so it seems like they had their priorities straight when trying to add cars to this game :/. They also seriously like to add cars from previous Forza games & pass them off as ""new additions"" - I dont mind there being cars from previous games, but stop trying to gaslight us on the Forza Monthly streams into thinking they are new to the series. - We want cars we haven't driven before, not ones we've driven hundreds of times. And REALLY like adding supercars or sports cars, which I understand the appeal - but seriously I want my sleeper cars back, makes more sense to have them especially with an apparently ""better"" street scene in this game. Theres also a severe lack of appearance customisations, most cars have 1 spoiler option, and 90% have no options for bodykits, or really anything that most people would want to change. Its not too big a deal, but it'd be nice to have some more customisation options. Online & Bugs - OH BOY I have a lot to say about this. Theres been a day one bug, that continues to wreak havoc on our convoy sessions, that has recieved no fix or even acknowledgement by the devs. & that is the random freezing that happens occasionally when you rewind. In single player, this isnt much of an issue. However in multiplayer, especially if it happens when you accidentally hit rewind, it can seriously kill the mood of everyone in the convoy, and make even the most passive person ragequit. Fix the damn bug already. The online experience is awful, you cant join your friends convoy ingame anymore like you could in FH4, you now have to use the ""Xbox Game Bar"" otherwise you cant play with your friends, its once again an odd choice considering they already had the framework to join other's games in FH4. Its also a massive middle finger to anyone who runs this on linux through proton, since they can no longer join their friends games as its now OS locked. The biggest annoyance personally has been something that they absolutely refuse to fix, and thats the lack of balance between the cars. If you've ever driven the boneshaker (or most of the cars added by the Hot Wheels DLC now) you'll be aware of how absurdly overpowered they are, if you encounter a Boneshaker in A Class open, you will not be fighting for 1st place, you'll be fighting for 2nd because the boneshaker has finished the race 20 seconds before anyone else did. I want to love this game more, but the lack of care the developers have to actually rescore the cars to match what their actual performance is, its genuinely awful. Its worse knowing that these cars have been known to be broken since day 1, and there has been literally nothing done by the devs to actually fix them. So you'll always encounter them in Open or Tour. I want to say this game is good, I really do, I love playing it, and I love being in the game racing. But I feel like this game could be a LOT better with next to no effort from the development team. They could fix the unbalanced cars and instantly make the game 100x more fun to play online. They could remove cheated leaderboard scores & make getting the highest score mean something. They could actually add unique cars to the region, or listen to their damn community, but they won't. This feels like a ""safe profit"" game. A game manhandled by some execs into losing its soul just so it could be an easy game to profit from. It feels corporate, its not the same horizon you had as a child/teen on your xbox 360, and its not the same game as the previous title. Its a soulless husk of a game within a series that was at one point the greatest open world racing experience. I'm still going to play it, its one of the only open-world racing games & I dont exactly have a choice to fill that niche. I want this game to be the best it can be, but it really feels like i've joined just as the ship was going down. Good Graphics wont save a game with an awful experience, and this has been a champion of awful experiences lately.",0.866982042789459229

Requires Forza Horizon 5 game, expansion sold separately.",Playground Games,Forza Horizon 5,Xbox Game Studios,"This game is great. It has over 500 cars, a massive world to explore, endless possibilities of car builds that add fun to the gameplay itself, and a lot more that you should explore for yourself. So why the negative review? 1. Post-launch updates and support is horrible and sometimes straight-up negligent. I'm primarily focused on the online open racing and here's a list of problems that I've encountered: - Broken Headlights: The developers have changed all online street races to night-time only, but the headlights are broken so the game constantly looks pitch-black. Update 2/11/22: the headlight glitch not only happens on street races but also on road races online as well. - Cheating. Cheaters who race online are not banned. Glitched times have taken over the top of every rivals leader boards and they're not getting banned or have their records taken off. If you raced a track in a blueprint event, your time has a chance to get posted onto the leader board as well. Yet if you made a livery with the North Korean leader on it you'll get a 800-yr ban or smth. - Horrendous track designs: this in my opinion is what turned most players away from offroad races. Have fun when you made a 3000-ft blind jump only to find a 3-ft wide checkpoint right next to you after that, OR ramps placed perfectly to flip your car/truck over. - Connection Issues: I use ethernet but still constantly got disconnected from online lobbies that I've already locked in. The game was flat-out unplayable online at launch but the developers managed to fix most of em. Long wait time still happens occasionally which could take up to 10 minutes from my experience. 2. Contents -Many cars were missing from fh4, which the developers claimed to be from licensing issues but some fh4 cars are still available thru seasonal rewards or forzathon shops but not in AUTOSHOW? wth? -Cars in general are more powerful in their respective classes comparing to the previous horizon: an A800 car in fh5 handles like ~S1/850 cars in fh4, which makes higher classes harder to handle, especially on S1 and S2 dirt and off-road races, where super cars or even formula drift cars with off-road tires more competitive than actual off-road cars/trucks. - Speaking of cars, meta cars are more dominant in this game than in fh4. Take a look at different leaderboards and the top is always dominated by them. While you can still make your own tunes and compete with them online, this issue is worse than the previous horizon, as in fh5 cars like Bone Shaker require little to no skill to be driven fast and competitive. >>So that's been said, is the game still worth buying?<< Yes! Personally I think the singleplayer contents are amazing. The expeditions and showcase events are well-designed and exciting to play. The story mode is fun and helps you get familiar with the driving mechanics too. Even if you're not into racing games or cars in general, this game could still be an amazing experience for the driving, exploration, and customization. Besides the car packs, which come with the premium edition, all the cars in the game can be bought in autoshow with in-game credits or acquired thru seasonal challenges. Kudos to PGG for making a game with virtually no micro transactions. At the very least, the game's graphics on ultra and extreme are just eye-candy and it's surprisingly well optimized on low-end hardware as well. You can get smooth 60fps with medium graphics on a GTX1660 and it still looks better than a lot of other racing games out there. As a matter of fact someone posted this test on YouTube where you can actually run this game without any graphic cards to begin with. edited 2/11/22: the side quests in different expeditions add a bit of a RPG-feeling to the game. This is a very creative move in racing games and I'm glad the devs came out of this idea. Also the freeroam rush between each dirt/offroad online races in fh4 was also removed here. Good riddance. >>So why the downvote?<< As of now, there are just too many gameplay-affecting issues that the developers need to address in future updates. As someone who mainly spends time in online lobbies, the experiences I've had with these issues are just not pleasant. Right now the series desperately need some competition in the same category: sim-cade racers, to show how PGG should handle post-launch supports properly. Until all the issues have been not only addressed but also fixed, I'll keep this down vote. Thx for reading.",0.863298296928405762

Horizon is a good game, but it's also a game that has not changed in any meaningful way since 3 and 4. Sure, the handling characteristics have improved... But what about the shitty AI, the glitchy physics, the overpowered vehicles, the bad lobby systems, the world that constantly feels empty of players, unlike how it was advertised... etc Forza Horizon has become the widest ocean of a racing videogame, with the depth of a puddle. Outside of those motivated by competition, the game feels nothing more than an empty sandbox. It's a pretty sandbox, but the collectibles feel like pointless, rewardless grinds. The festival sights are still just un-interactable fields of uncanny, unreactive crowds. There are no meaningful rewards in this game for dedicated players. The showcases feel dull, meaningless, rubberband-fests. Some horizon chapters just straight up let you cheat, and some don't... why...? I don't want to keep talking trash about this game, because it's genuinely fun, it's neat. But, it doesn't feel like a labor of love, it feels like labor for money. Why innovate when recreating the formula saves money? If I'm being honest, I think I would rather be playing Forza Horizon 4, because it runs better, despite being on the exact same engine and it's now completely incompatible with some older gpus that could run 4 on highest settings.... And since forza horizon physics are affected by your FPS, since 4 also runs better, the physics are also better. The fact that we got seasons and then they just got rid of them? The world in 5 does not change in any way nearly as meaningfully as 4. 4 was ambitious compared to 3, 5 is lethargic, formulaic compared to 4. The hot wheels dlc in 3 slapped, the hot wheels dlc here is mid, almost feels like a nostalgia cash grab for 3's players. I'm gonna keep putting hours into this game, but sometimes I feel like I'd rather be stuck in traffic than playing the most formulaic videogame I have ever owned. tl;dr It's a decent game, but, PLEASE do yourself a favor and mute the speech volume.",0.849737942218780518

And is ruined by the absolute shameful, unforgivable AI (or lack thereof). See, the drivatars you race against are a complete lie. There is no AI, there is no intelligence. Non-human cars do not obey the same physic as you do. They follow the racing line at a preset speed (which depends on the difficulty setting), as if they were on rails, no matter what car they're in. Only once you are very close to them does physic start to influence them, at which point they completely forget how to drive and usually brake, even if in a straigh road. So, your only chance to win (at higher difficulty level) is to take the lead very early, usually in the first few corners, by dive-bombing and ramming. Failing that, once the lead car get a couple of seconds in front of you (you always start a race mid-pack, so you're always at a disadvantage), you can forget about catching up. Just restart the race and ram harder... Oh, and obviously they cheat, they accelerate much faster than you, and in the off chance you get a significant lead, they rubberband back to you at insane speeds. Of course, you can lower the difficulty, at which point the game becomes a walk in the park. Not fun either. It is such a shame, because Forza Horizon 5 is a fun car game, but a terrible racing game...

Nothing beats the feeling of taking your favorite car, wrapping it in a cool livery, and going ham on the roads. So why am I not recommending it? Well, there are a few reasons, and it all has to do with how the devs are running the show. The devs will ban you for dumb reasons like making livery that's somewhat political in nature perhaps, but then they don't ban the clear cheaters on the leaderboards. There are speedzone records that are legitimately impossible without glitching the game, and yet, the devs seem less interested in going after those guys. There are bugs that cause physics rubberbanding, bugs that cause visibility issues, but the devs would rather release multiple patches to make it harder and harder to obtain super wheelspins. They straight up removed the super wheelspin masteries from several cars, because they were too cheap to obtain. The harder level AI is absurd and does not obey the same physics which bind the players, they will rubberband up to the the player if behind, but you as a player can almost never catch up to AI ahead of you. There's a running joke that you have to ram the AI off the road, or else you can't actually win. The rewards for a lot of the weekly seasonal challenges are garbage, like shitty horns and crappy clothing items. Speaking of clothing, there are a ton of them littering the wheelspins, and you're probably more likely to get a pair of socks than a car. The game would rather license yet another Italian exotic, than license actual interesting D, C, and B range cars. There's a glaring lack of European cars, and yet we have a shit ton of Ferarri cars, and yet somehow we don't have the Testarossa. Where are brands like Alfa, Fiat, and Lancia? And I haven't even scratched the surface of the issues.

If you value lots of car, lots of places to just hang around and build your dream car, this game is awesome. BUT. If you go to highter tier difficulty Pro/Unbeatable, prepare for frustration. Not because the AI is good, but because those lazy developers made it so enemy cars don't answer phisics. Change of road type? You drift like mad as they go on rails. High jump? you could bottom out and lose lots of speed while the AI simply lands softly without losing speed. Found a good trajectory? Sorry enemy AI slams you from behind! They could have just taken the top pilots, used their times and telemetry to actually make good AI. This is PURE LAZYNESS from the devs, who could have made us face the best of the best pilots of this game, and get amazed by perfect tunings and trajectories, forcing us to sweat to improve to their level. Instead they made the AI cheat its way to victory, forcing you to either slam into them to break their speed or find other cheesy exploits. This is why, until they fix the AI, i will keep a negative review. Fix the AI and it's a most-reccomended game. ""Can you win at pro/unbeatable?"" Yes, you can. Not impossible BUT. You will end up smashing into cars to slow them and slam into corners to keep as much momentum as phisically (im)possible. For a racing game it's tatamount to need to cheese the game to out-cheese the AI. It's not something one expects from such a AAA game studio. And of course, if you ever let the lead car go beyond 100 metres, it will completely ignore obstacles, so the small branches slowling you down or somewater will have zero effect on a too far away car, meaning you get the penalty of obeying in-game phisics as the AI ignores it completely. Update: it's useless to write ""lol u bad"". If you never saw the AI cars glued on the ground for what would have been a 100 meters jump, you are literally blind. Kudos on playing a game about cars while blind tho. That takes skill. Update 2: INCREDIBLE! NOW THE FIXED THE GAME! And by that i mean they updated the code of conduct. In a game with no chat. And the usual ""railroaded AI car that sprint more than you and ignore phisics"" is still there in all its glory. And for new cars....we got some electric stuff and nothing much more. WHAT DOES A MAN HAVE TO DO TO HAVE A MERCEDES SLR? THE LATEST BUGATTI? INSTEAD OF THIS SILLY THINGS GIVE US CARS AND AI BASED ON REAL TRACK STATISTICS! AND FIX THE EXPLOIT YOUS TILL HAVE PEOPLE SUBMITTING ALMOST ZERO TIME IN TRACKS.",0.827148616313934326

First... you should know that this game is a huge improvement over FH4 in just about every way. Graphics are gorgeous. Terrain and race tracks are much more varied and characterful. They seem to have fixed the issues with convoys and multiplayer queues crashing (we used to average around one race every hour trying to play competitive in a convoy). Tons of stuff to do for everybody whether that be drifting, road racing, or just roaming around and exploring. So many positive things it's hard to overstate how impressed I am. The reason I have to vote ""no"" right now is the most important aspect of any racing game... the racing. Right now the game is making such an attempt to be new-user friendly that what you actually do in a race really has no real impact. It doesn't matter if you carefully upgrade a track weapon, lovingly tune it, and then drive like a zen master. You will do exactly as well as someone who takes a car without upgrades and just barrels around the track wildly, crashing into every wall and corner. The AI will also ""smooth"" their performance to how well you are doing. Did you bring a 260 mph top speed missile? Every AI driver will be able to do 265, even in tiny little cars with a quarter of your horsepower that are designed to be nimble instead of fast. Did you bring a darty little car and plan to earn places in the corners? Every AI will take that same corner flat out, even when in massive muscle cars that should struggle to complete gentle corners. When every car feels roughly the same, when your level of effort and knowledge in building them don't matter, and when how you drive them has no real impact in how you place, then what's the point? I'm really hoping this is an initial bug to be worked out. If the situation improves, I will JOYFULLY recommend this game. But until that happens, be aware that a twelve year old picking up the controller for the very first time will be actively competitive against someone with 1000+ hours of racing experience under their belt. May as well just watch gameplay videos at that point.",0.82532966136932373

But I can't recommend it, because for me it's horizon 4 with a new map. I think the game mostly improved in the areas where it was already good, and became only worse in it's weak spots. So at this moment I believe that it makes more sense to buy horizon 4 with discount. Pros: Basically all the pros of horizon 4, so I keep it short. + Graphics is great. + Car sounds are good. Soundtrack is okay. + Plenty of cars. + Flexible tuning. + Large map. Cons: - No feeling of progression at all. Game just throws at you the best cars in first 20 hours of gameplay. You can open almost everything from a wheelspins without do a single race. In a race game. - AI. Maybe it was the same in Horizon 4, but in this game it looks so fake. Many times I have a situation when I overtake all the drivatars, and they just form a train and ride like this (one after another on exactly the same line) till the finish. So they don't even try to imitate the real race and competition. And yes, they don't care about the game physics. If race has a jumps or water in it, drivatars have a huge advantage, because the terrain doesn't affect their cars. - ""YoU'rE a SuPeRsTaR!!!111"". It is way too much this time. All these radio announcements sound so unnatural, you are praised for absolutely everything. They don't reward, they just cause facepalms. - Stories are mostly meaningless and dialogs are weird. In one of the stories there is a phrase like ""Why people don't like sandstorms?! They're so fun!"". I mean there should be a line somewhere in being so optimistic and positive, right? Horizon has so great potential for a proper singleplayer campaign, but it's just a waste of time now. - Constant interruptions. New adventure! New wheelspin! New level after a race! Dancing before the race (WHY?)! Dancing after a race (WHY?)! - I can't say much about the online, because it constantly disconnects me, I was able to complete only a few races. And I still can't find an option to find a race in a specific class. It's so frustrating.

Requires Forza Horizon 5 game, expansion sold separately.",Playground Games,Forza Horizon 5,Xbox Game Studios,"This game does so much right, but it sucks as a ""game."" The problem: It relies solely on the monthly Festival Playlists for engaging gameplay events, but when that's over, it has no legs to stand on because the core multiplayer experience is completely undercooked. With hundreds of cars and dozens of tracks, this game has... 5 pools with 4 performance classes, all consisting of bog standard races. It's the epitome of boring, and the fixes are so simple: • In each weekly Playlist, there are PvE events that offer fantastic variety: Themed events around specific types of cars, like SUVs or 50's muscle, at one point they experimented with stock-only races putting everyone on a level playing field. Why are these not rotating PvP events? • Ranked from FH4 was removed, ignoring obvious fixes such as making it non-contact. This also renders leaderboards worthless since there's no competitive rankings, not to mention they're all hacked. • Team races from FH4? Gone. • Endurance tracks, like the Colossus and Goliath, are absent from the track rotation. One of my best memories in this game was PvP on those tracks before they removed them in a patch. • The entire drag race type is ignored completely. • C and D performance classes are not included. It legitimately blows my mind how much multiplayer potential this game is leaving on the table. So, what's left? Eventlab 2.0 is the best in-game track editor I've seen that isn't outright dedicated mod tools. Great! Except getting to race on those with other people is essentially impossible beyond organized parties. With the removal of servers from FH4, players phase in an out of the map, making it impossible for people to congregate and naturally form convoys, not to mention cars are ""ghosted"" so you can't hardly see or engage with other players anyway. PGG isn't facilitating PvP Eventlab races, so that's another avenue gone. The Eliminator has completely busted vehicle balance that hasn't been addressed since launch, ignoring foundational issues such as an awkward, often unfair final race. The party games are just that, maybe you like capture the flag, I for one prefer to race. Horizon Tour PvE, while featuring an interesting rotation of car restrictions, is considerably less interesting compared to the Trial because of its lowered difficulty. This ultimately means one thing: The main way in which you engage with this game is through the Festival Playlist. That's where you find interesting races through the Seasonal Championships, play multiplayer (albeit PvE) Eventlab races, play challenging PvE Trial races against ""Unbeatable"" difficulty AI, and so on. Additionally, the devs have done a fantastic job offering a steady flow of new cars, which makes the Playlist very rewarding to complete every week. But as soon as that dries up? With no serious singleplayer content and real means of interacting to other players outside of the extremely stilted and simple multiplayer, it's game over; the rest of what this game offers is disjointed, hamstrung, and honestly, geared to just make you buy Forza Horizon 6 and leave this whole experience, with all of its potential, behind.",0.814371705055236816

Forza horizon 5 excels in areas previous titles lacked and fails in areas the franchise had previously mastered. Car customization, map scale and track design are all excellent. The problem comes from the AI. As someone who played most previous titles forza 1 - horizon 3 on the top difficulty settings I expected the typical AI design but was instead met with the rubber banding of a typical ubisoft racing game release. The mechanics directly punish you for doing better as the AI gets shorter lap times whenever you do. This is further worsened by the fact that each race regardless of track size is flooded with AI racers that follow the exact on rails driving line. The AI brakes, turns and accelerates so similarly that every race feels like you are competing against a bullet train. You will NEVER beat an AI off the line since they have godmode acceleration for the first 5 seconds, and they will take corners at double the speed a player could realistically take. AI cars hit speeds normally unbachieveable at the class. To win a race, the strategy is to banzai bomb straight for the corner, and then aggressively block the AI for the remainder of the race. So long as you don't get too far ahead of them they wont gain rubber band acceleration and the AI all but shuts off.",0.799638509750366211

Now, I have played this game probably for the longest time out of all the forza horizon installments. however, to me it still feels like a mixed bag. heres why: 1. It just feels like Forza Horizon 4. The previous games all had different improvements over the game before. FH2 added a bigger open world, FH3 added better car customization and even bigger open world, FH4 added seasons that change the world in a quite unique way, but what big and impactful feature got added with FH5? Offroad tires on every car? Local weather events that rarely happens? While it does have some smaller QoL additions, overall FH5 just seems like a sequel or spin-off to FH4 and not a new installment of the main series. 2. The carpark honestly feels pretty empty, despite being massive, if not bigger than the previous games. Some manufacturers are missing, like Lancia or Abarth, or sometimes just some stand alone cars, like the 1966 Chevrolet Nova. But on the other hand, we got a bunch of super cars that all look similar and arent very unique. So you essentially end up with a carpark that is bloated with generic vehicles and doesnt have many that stand out. While this is mostly a personal gripe, someone else might disagree with, it still gets quite boring when you add new cars to the game, you have either already seen in other games or are just an expensive trim of an existing car with a better engine. Speaking of adding cars... 3. the new cars that get added with seasonal events. Once again, probably just a personal gripe, but it might still be orth mentioning. Every week, the developers add new cars to the game. HOWEVER...for the last few months those cars were a bit of a let down. You got stuff like an AMC Javelin...which was available in previous games. Then you got a Cadillac Limousine...which was also in previous games. Theres also the Rimac Nevera...which is just a Rimac Concept Two that drives differently. But hey, theres also the Cadillac CT5-V...and the CT4-V in the same season...which look similar...You get the point. The recent series rewards are kinda bland. Although it does look better with the current series (May 11th, 2023), so who knows what the future brings. HOWEVER, its also important to remember that all the problems with the carpark and the series rewards could very well just be licensing issues. the reason, why there is no lancia or fiat isnt, because the developers got bored of it, but because the license ran out. But I dont have behind the scenes information, so thats just an assumption. 4. The Map. Ima be honest, Im not a big fan of the map. Does it look good? Yes. Does it feel good? ehhh...As big as the map is, it honestly feels pretty empty overall. There arent that many memorable places, apart from a few towns and maybe a few natural formations. Another problem I have with the map is how small of an impact seasons actually make. In Forza Horizon 4, theres actually a decently sized difference between seasons with winter being all snowy, fall with the red leaves and wet streets. But in FH5? You could show me an ingame screenshot of the environment and I couldnt tell you which season it might be, even if you held me at gunpoint. Maybe the focus with the seasons was more the localized events, like sandstorms or heavy rain, but I feel like those barely happen. and even then...they are localized. you wont notice them, if you are on the opposite side of the map. 5. I have heard from some people that the game also has some issues with the DLCs, multiplayer lobbies, performance and some other things, but those are mostly things that I havent experienced yet or arent big issues for me. If you wanna know more about those, probably better to watch some videos about them or read some articles or something. I cant give much input there. With that being said, why should you get FH5 then, if it has so many issues? Well...those gripes are honestly just things that I PERSONALLY have issues with (and some other people as well). And it still has some nice QoL and can get you some hours for the price. If you dont care about the mentioned issues and you want more of FH4, or, if you just wanna dip your toes into the franchise, then you might enjoy the game. Otherwise you might wanna save your money for something else, or buy FH4 instead. TLDR: The game has issues, no doubt. The map feels pretty bland, the carpark feels empty and the series rewards feel boring, overall a pretty stale experience, once you reach endgame and start to run out of things you can do. Do I still recommend it, despite those issues? ehhh....Its essentially more of Forza Horizon 4. If you enjoyed that one, maybe buy Forza Horizon 5, when its 50% or more off, otherwise just stick to FH4 instead.",0.797602295875549316

Main complaint, only one person gets the camera, so only one person REALLY is in control of how well you do, leading the others to feel sort of useless. The film in the camera is limited per run, so if you start to ""have fun"" by larping as a reporter or film team, you blow through the film too quickly and end up failing the objective. Metagaming the objective by doing short clips of each scoring thing makes for a boring film and the rest of the players basically useless, its a single player experience masquerading as multiplayer. 2. A lot of the monsters it feels like there is little to no counterplay, other than ""Avoid"", which feels cheap and unfun especially when their patrol routes block your only way in 3. The difficulty is weird. With each passing day the numbers get bigger, but the ""View"" scaling seems to scale just as linearly as the objective, so really you do the exact same thing over and over without it actually getting harder, unless you get RNG'd into a bad enemy spawn point If they want to make a fun game where you make short horror films with your friends and watch them back, commit to that, and get rid of the roguelike elements of it, the limited film is a bad mechanic in pursuit of that.

The main flaws: It gets old quick The art style (specifically of the below) Luck based I think the idea of the world is really good! A bright bubbly floating island with the old world below covered in, what I assume is, rot and full of monsters; What's not to love? But this falls apart when you go to the below world and realise that practically everything down there is the same UV map, and it is ridiculously hard to navigate. With everything looking the same I have gotten lost countless times, to the point I don't even want to explore deeper. Secondly, it gets old and boring fast. Only a few runs in did I understood the gimmick, which was good, but if you're not a content creator yourself and just the average joe you may find this experience a bit less engaging. Watching youtubers play this, they clearly were having far more fun and I was overjoyed by that. Clearly, this game has an audience, I just may not be that audience. Thirdly, there is so much luck involved. Sometimes you get a million monsters, sometimes you get one shot instantly and lose everything. Sometimes it takes ages and you only get a snail. I don't know if this is just my experience, but it makes it a lot harder to continue reaching the view count quota with this issue. I think the monsters are really cool, ranging from stupid looking like the mixer to really creepy, like the grabby hand explosive guy. The only real thing is, they all have the same skin! It's so dull! I understand the purpose of this, but I really think it'd help make them more memorable if they had some variations! I do think this game has a good sense of humour though, the character designs and changeable face plates are super fun and makes the group stand out against the dreary place below. The equipment, especially the sound maker personally, are super fun! The group is encouraged to stick together because of one thing; the camera. Everyone wants to be on camera, and from my understanding the viewers like when they see everyone. But this limits exploration! You can't split up and have separate harrowing experiences, or when you do, they are left uncaptured which is really sad! I think a great addition to the game would be a second camera: Half the film, double the risk. It would mean you could split up in groups of two and at the end there could be a compilation of the two sides making lots of opportunities for funny cutaways. Another addition I think would improve this game is perhaps daily goals. Maybe after the first 3 days you start getting highlighted comments requesting to see specific things, and you can choose to act on them. For example, show off how a snail damages you, see a star barnacle thing, maybe catch an explosion live on camera. This would add an element of speed to the game as well as you rush to find the things these commenters want. Of course, if this was a feature, it'd have to be made possible and not just luck based. Overall, I think this game as of right now is fun in the beginning but quickly grows boring. But if it updates and adds new features, it can become something incredible. I am holding onto that hope, and I wish the developers all the best. Even if I may not personally enjoy it all that much, I still see merit in this game, and in the fun others are having with it. Also, it's bloody cheap, I can't be too picky can I?",0.763081550598144531

Every video me and my friends have made has felt insanely forced. I assume this game was made with the idea of Lethal Company clips becoming insanely popular online, but those were funny because none of those in game interactions were forced. This game's goal is to make those clips happen, which just makes everything feel so unnatural unfortunately. - The game desperately needs more maps. The same map with a slight bit of randomization in layout is super boring, and adds to why the game gets stale super fast. - Movement doesn't feel good. It feels like the physics were forced into a game they weren't designed for, and sometimes makes me feel like I sometimes get punished for things that aren't my fault. - I wish the game was more clear on what gets more views. 90% of runs, it feels like no matter what we record, we get the same amount of views. One time, we just recorded ourselves at the house, none of which in the underground, and got pretty close to the same amount of views. - I wish we could buy stuff in the shop sooner.

The game needs a lot of work. In it's current state it feels very unpolished -- not to be confused with it's purposely funny jankness. The game seems to be inspired by Lethal Company, which is perfectly fine, I love Lethal Company. Despite that, the levels feel very cheap compared to Lethal Company. I'm not actually sure if there's random generation here, but it feels very much thrown in. Lethal feels like it has more thought put in to monster spawning and the design of the level. This feels very weird and awkward with monsters just randomly spawning everywhere from the get-go. The 'Turret Dog' monster just camped the ship at the end of one level and I ended up dying to it because of the sluggish movement. I could've waited until it left, but it doesn't feel suspenseful or fun. Just very boring. It wouldn't have been too big of a problem, but easily one of the best features of this game is the camera footage you can record and get played back to you after a level, which you cannot see if you all die. You lose all that footage, which is disappointing. Losing footage on death definitely ups the stakes for dying, but not in an interesting way at all, it comes off as frustrating. My mic also didn't work well in the game. I've always had a bit of a quiet mic, but it was never an issue in Lethal. Here, one of my friends outright couldn't hear me half the time and in the camera footage, I was EXTREMELY quiet. I do really like the customizable faces though, they're really cool. I don't know, the game has a good concept but a lot of the execution just falls flat for me. I think Lethal is easily the better choice and I'm glad I got this when it was free, as I would not recommend paying $7.99 for this at this point in time. EDIT: I do realize I compare it to Lethal Company a good few times in this review. That is because the game is again, clearly inspired by Lethal. I think comparing two similar games and what they have done right and wrong is reasonable.",0.649646282196044922

Taking the idea of funny lethal company clips and making those clips the main goal of the game is extremely clever game design, but it is also flawed in it's core. That's because all of those funny lethal company clips are funny only because they occured naturally, as a byproduct of the lethal company main gameplay loop. In this game, the clips ARE the main gameplay loop. Because of that critical difference, clips in this game feel extremely forced and unnatural, and only rarely produce any fun. It would be much better if we had some useful instruments or traps to make the monster interactions fun, but now we only have 2 boring stunning weapons that do nothing to actually entertain you. Additionally, this game suffers from complete absence of any meaningful lore. There is a generic colorful rainbow island you live on, and there is a scary dark city filled with monsters and rotating gears. That's all. No text messages to be found. No pieces of lore to uncover. No monster encyclopedia. Nothing. The worldbuilding simply does not exist in this game, and it makes the entire game even more meaningless. In conclusion we have a small game that revolves around a good basic idea that is unfortunately not developed and is not accompanied by other mechanics. It is completely fine for a free game (which it used to be for the first 24 hours), but for a price any higher than half a dollar this game just does not perform well enough. It isn't even marked as an early access game, though it completely is an early access game. Makes me wonder if the developers actually do not plan to release any new updates, or just wanted to trick people into thinking this game is a complete product.",0.630193710327148438

I'm really just saying that it's incomplete. Once you figure out the main gameplay loop, there is no tension or skill expression or anything. It's a funny idea, but it needs so much more content to get the idea to actually work. I get the idea; filming funnies like Lethal Company is a great idea. But fabricating those sorts of moments drags a lot of the fun out of it, and plus trying to ""make a video to go viral"" it itself an idea that inherently leads to burnout. Everything feels inconsequential. The game is funny and I like the silly physics; it definitely has potential. But right now, it just isn't in the state it needs to be. Trying to be a self-aware YouTuber isn't funny after the first 5 minutes, and if you don't have friends to play with that fill in 90% of the experience, then this game is going to bore you to death with the way it is right now. Furthermore, there is another critical error that makes Lethal Company way better in this genre, and that's that success is directly correlated to metrics that you explicitly participate in. You pick up an item and it has a value. You bring that item back and you can see it. If you get enough explicit value, then you live to see the next set of days. In this game, you don't really know what to expect from the results of a video. It could bomb, it could do amazing, or it could kind of be middling, and there is little in the way of understanding how that all works other than guessing at its nature. If your success ultimately lies outside of your control, then it's hard to be motivated to continue going with it, because it starts getting irritating that you aren't rolling the dice well enough. All in all, I think the game definitely has potential, but right now it has misguided core gameplay elements that leave it as little more than something you can enjoy with friends for one or maybe two nights. It has nothing to keep you playing. I did enjoy my time with it because I had friends that made it fun at least, so if you already own it, it doesn't hurt to give it a shot for a couple hours.",0.581616461277008057

The whole game is meant to be recording funny clips of your friends getting terrorised by monsters to meet a quota of views with no other real main objective, which makes most of the gameplay feel completely forced. You spend maybe a good amount of time looking for the monsters, which means most of the time you're just like ""wow look at these spinning gears and emotes we have guys"" until you eventually come across a monster. And even then, some of the monsters are just boring as hell to run into or are too overpowered to where it's essentially game over if you encounter them. The snail monster seems to only exist to record your friend getting grabbed for a few seconds, the whisker seems to only exist to record it tweaking on the ground like some Vancouver citizen OD'ing in broad daylight while other people surround it recording it, and then you have stupid monsters like the barnacle that are a total waste of time. If you get caught by this thing, you may as well just go AFK because it's game over for you as you'll just slowly die no matter how hard you button mash to get out, and if your friends revive you you'll just be stuck again. You can't even free people using the taser so what's the point??? Monsters like the grenade throwing dude and the boston dynamics dog are fun encounters since they actually create panic without being like the giant or throwing monster where if you don't have a full bar of stamina you're completely screwed. For the first few hours, it's hilarious when you and your friends die. But the more you play, the more the laughter just turns into an ""ugh looks like we're pressing F3 to save the footage again"". There's like 3 maps total so there's barely anything to change up the gameplay loop other than the occasional ""we added lasers in the hallway"" or ""this trapdoor is now open instead of closed"". The thing that made Lethal Company fun was the fact the game had an objective and fun upgrades for your ship that made going above the quota feel worth it, while the scares you get from the monsters was secondary and not the only focus of the game. Lethal Company was still fun once you got bored of the vanilla game because of the amount of mods it had that actually improved the game by adding more player slots, letting monsters go outside, actual upgrades for you and your friends, and other mods that would make the monsters even more terrifying to deal with (like the maskless doppelgangers). Meanwhile this game's modding potential isn't all that great because the vanilla game itself barely has anything to offer. You can't even add more player slots since Photon has a hard cap of 4 players. And most other mods just make the game easier like making items free or giving you infinite health/stamina.

There is also an issue where some of the items are overpriced (such as the taser), in which makes it actually difficult due to the unpredictability of said spawn points and also the confusing technique of how views work (and how you get AD REVENUE/views).

Since Elden Ring is a game where you have to dodge/react to the opponents attacks in under a secound, this makes Bossfights frustrating beyond believe and honestly kinda unplayable at least in my eyes. I dont mind having to try a boss over and over because i make a mistake, but constantly dying, because the game freezes for 1 secound so i couldnt see which type of attack the boss is throwing at me is not the kind of challenge i am looking forward to.

Sometimes they can last a second or longer becoming extremely frustrating. Walking around stuttering is frequent, my CPU is running at 4.8Ghz regularly on one core and yet and most of the other cores are sleeping, GPU usage is only 40% or so and I've tried lowering settings but to no avail.

I wanted to like it so badly, but I can't bring myself to even complete a second play-through. This review will contain spoilers so I advise skipping this review unless you have thoroughly completed the game. Firstly, I'd like to start off with the great things this game does; Better Melee Variety: I love how there are different viable attacks when fighting with melee weapons, ashes of war (while some are quite busted), is a great mechanic to shake up monotonous melee combat. I love that charged strong attacks, and jumping attacks are not only viable, but some of the strongest attacks you can do. I love how shields can be altered and tweaked to match your build wonderfully, and how useful they feel when performing guard breaks. World Design & Aesthetics: This game, while being a souls-like, does an amazing job at separating itself from the look of the other souls games. The high-fantasy themes really show through in this games most beautiful areas. Even enemies and bosses themselves look amazing. This game easily has the best visuals, aesthetics, and design out of all of fromsoftwares current titles. Exploration, Sense of Scale, Level Design: This game feels massive with so many different things you can do, and so many enemies to fight. The legacy dungeons are all so fun to explore, and make for some of the most classic souls-borne gameplay. Now on to the cons I have with the game; Boss & Enemy Design: Truly the most upsetting thing about this game for me. The simplest way to sum up this issue is that it feels as if your character in Elden Ring is from Dark Souls 1, and the enemies are ported from Dark Souls 3. I really have no issues with bosses having never-ending combos of attacks, granted that I have the equal and opposite ability to properly react and evade. The combat in Elden Ring often feels challenging in the wrong way. Bosses more often than not have combos that never seem to end, and also an apparent fetish for aoe moves. I also find the bosses enjoy falling into a loop of repeating moves time and time again, spamming the same moves until your corpse is butchered to a pulp. My character ended the game with 60 Vitality, and it still felt like I never had enough hp. Armour seems to have little to no purpose, as I have to invest in endurance and sacrifice one trinket slot to have a dollar tree version of Havel's Ring in order to wear armour that feels no stronger than paper mache. The amount of repeated bosses in this game is really disheartening. After exploring catacomb #59 and finding the misbegotten warrior and another trash mob in an arena, the sense to explore is a fleeting feeling. It is tragic, and feels horribly lazy and under-cooked. No other fight drives this point home better than the Godskin Duo. If you've been playing the game to the highest extent, then you've fought these enemies multiple times: Caelid Tower, the Witches Village, Volcano Manor, etc. Already, you've seen these bosses far too many times to count. However, the creme de la creme is awaiting you at the Crumbling Faram Azura where you have to fight them for one last hurrah, both at the same time. This is an essential fight you need to do to beat the game. I really implore anyone that avidly enjoys this game, what was the purpose of putting this fight there? I find myself asking this question far often than I should when I encounter a reused boss in an area that didn't need a boss. It seems that a major strategy of Elden Ring is to avoid engaging with the boss, most if not every ""challenging"" boss follows this same logic. Fighting Radhan? Just hit him a couple times stage one then spam the summons second stage and never attack him directly. Fighting Melania? Just stun-lock her and use mimic tear to take aggro off you so when she uses her 1000 hit combo the fight just doesn't abruptly end. The list goes on with people listing ""just use bleed"", ""bloody slash"", ""use magic"", ""use x ash of war and spam it until they're dead"", ""use the rotten stray and proc scarlet rot"", ""insert exploit here"". None of these are proper solutions. Did you feel a sense of accomplishment when you bloody slashed the 27th boss to death? Did you feel satisfied when your mimic tear summon solo'ed the boss? Did you have fun watching scarlet rot tick down that boss you've been struggling to beat? You shouldn't have to re-spec to fight certain bosses, every fight should have viable solutions and a sense that every play-style has a chance to win. Whether that chance be low, or high, it should always feel possible, and it shouldn't feel like the odds are so stacked against you that you have to make do and essentially exploit the game to continue on. This entire game comes to a climax inside the Erd Tree, in easily the most disappointing final boss in all of souls. I still remember the first time I fought Gwyn, Gherman, and the Soul of Cinder. Each of these games built up their final fights so immensely well, it was a challenge I was overjoyed with. Walking through the fog gate into Gwyn's boss room is a feeling I will never feel again. The dread, knowing that everything that I've accomplished has come to this final moment, and when I win, I can finally fulfil the prophecy foretold to me. I felt nothing when I got to the Elden Beast. I felt no sense of accomplishment, no joy, no fear, no happiness... just nothing. It felt like nothing had led up to that point, there was no build-up, no emotion, no struggle, no sense of accomplishment. Just a gauntlet of two mediocre bosses back to back. I really tried to enjoy this game, I really did, but the boss design in this game really brings it down many pegs for me, and kills all replay-ability this game ever could have. If you enjoyed this game, I'm happy for you, but I just want to voice my feelings for others that may have felt the same way. If you didn't like the game, that's ok! If you did, I'm happy you enjoyed it and could see past the things I took issue with. Overall, as a souls-like, this game simply does not do it for me, and maybe others may share my feelings as well.",0.726666867733001709

To put it mildly, this game feels as if the character has the moveset of Dark Souls 3 (with the additions of Counter guards and jumping attacks) while the enemies have the moveset of Bloodborne foes and the tracking of Sekiro enemies. Foes in this game are more punishing than ever with delayed attacks, enhanced tracking, and better AI. While this works, it feels like a bit too much in some instances. It feels like almost every enemy has some 2880-degree combo spin move, giant Area of Effect explosion, or some mix of both. In addition to these challenging attacks to deal with, enemy attacks are harder to read than ever, with many different combos having the same start-up or coming out incredibly fast. While this may be a product of the performance issues of the PC Port, some enemies feel as if they are fighting with a lag switch even if the game is not dropping frames or otherwise functioning normally. I have had numerous occasions where torrent your trusty steed will suddenly drop dead seemingly out of nowhere or instances where enemy health bars will strangely refill or moments where I will seemingly be ‘dead angled’ by attacks hitting me head-on. These factors are compounded by the damage enemies can do. It is not uncommon to see some field bosses or more challenging opponents doing 900+ damage in an attack which is a death sentence for numerous characters, especially when these attacks are also fast swinging and usually accompanied by area of effect damage. Simultaneously the game feels very starved when it comes to runes. While numerous rune farming areas have been discovered, it is surprisingly disproportionate regarding difficulty and the number of runes enemies drop. Some of the easiest foes in the game that can easily be stunlocked and killed without difficulty will drop over 1000 runes. Meanwhile, literal giants that can, on occasion, pose a threat drop similar rates of runes. It feels bizarre and unrewarding to see genuinely challenging regular foes drop so few runes instead of the commonly farmed areas. Speaking of being unrewarding, while this is probably a personal problem, I do not feel accomplished from defeating bosses in this game. I remember the hype of beating Ornstein and Smough, Gehrman, Pontiff Sulyvahn, and Isshin, the Sword Saint. When I power through and defeat a challenging boss in Elden Ring, I feel annoyed. Despite some of these bosses taking all of my skill and ability to beat a boss in Elden Ring, I do not feel the same excitement I did in previous games. I do not feel like I have accomplished something. It just feels frustrating. I am not entirely sure what causes this, but the game does not feel rewarding. Still, I will continue to play, and I will beat it. Perhaps once that is done, I will update my review and give a final score. However, this has been the least enjoyable of the Fromsoft games I have played for now. If you personally enjoy it, that is great and more power to you, but I have found the game unrewarding, annoying, and far more draining than any previous games. Rather than being left with a sense of accomplishment after clearing any milestone in the game, I remain left with a feeling of annoyance as if I have completed a tiresome chore rather than an epic boss battle. Update: It is a shame I am not playing Salt and Sanctuary, for this review has been a lucrative salt mine. Update 2: It appears this review has gotten quite a few responses! Welcome! As mentioned before, I will finish this game. Sunk cost fallacy or not, I paid for it, and I am far too deep to refund it now. As of the writing of this update, I am currently a level 90 pure strength build (I abandoned my original level 60 character after feeling like I had hit a wall with a two-handed quality build). At the moment, this character has hit a bit of a wall with Commander Niall. If this information helps with your headcannon about me, you are welcome! Update 3/Final Thoughts: Now that I have become Elden Lord, I still stand by most of what I have said. While there are moments of the game I genuinely enjoy, bosses such as the Fire Giant and the Godskin Duo are pretty emblematic of this game's boss design and philosophy. Tedious, frustrating, and more of a chore than something that can give actual hype. While there are genuinely great bosses that can get one hyped up and good early open-world design that allows the player to roam around without being walled off, I think many of the bosses feel less like a test of skill and more like a war of attrition, a war that you can lose highly quickly. However, it is a war I ultimately won, a feat that, at the time of this being typed, .8% of players (on steam) have achieved. I abandoned my first character after over 20 hours of gameplay and managed to beat it at level 110 in a little over 34 hours after some experimenting. There are good elements of this game, the world is beautiful, the fashion souls are as great as ever, and the customization has been taken to the next level. At the same time, though, the boss design is, in my opinion, some of the worst it has ever been. Simultaneously, there are many reused bosses and enemies, even for a Fromsoft and/or open-world game. This has always been the case in Fromsoft games, but this goes beyond even the Dark Souls 2 Pursuer level of reuse. There is good here in the game and moments of hype and excitement. However, it feels especially punishing for certain builds and playstyles at the same time. You don't need to ""git gud"" to beat many of these bosses if you ask me. If you check in on any guide, the answer seems to be most of the time, you simply need to ""git bleed"" or perhaps ""git spells."" Update 4 (seamless co-op mod): Since I first played this game until now, Elden Ring has had several significant patches and quite a few changes (real ones will know the pain of 1.0 Radahn). However, with the advent of mods, especially the seamless co-op mod, the game is substantially more fun. The co-op has been a saving grace of many Souls games, not necessarily because of how it can make things easier but also the fun community shenanigans that can occur. While I still think that, on its own, this is probably the weakest entry in From’s current line-up, the waves of patches that came in have made the game decisively better, and, furthermore, the seamless co-op mod has allowed something genuinely magical to come about. The game is substantially more fun and a lot more wondrous, in my opinion having a constant companion to play it with FAQ/Q&A: Did you try to adapt to Elden Ring mechanics? Yes! I used consumables, the mimic tear ashes (which is borderline mandatory in some bosses), jumping attacks, Torrent, followed the advice of seemingly everyone on the planet and got a bleed weapon, and I even dipped into faith to take a helpful incantation. These items can certainly make certain bosses more manageable especially bleeding. Since we are getting to the point where bosses regularly have over 25,000 HP, max HP damage feels more and more mandatory to make the game feel more playable. Will you continue to play the game? I might. I am thinking about maybe playing a character that focuses more on incantations or sorceries. I also desire to help struggling players against bosses I have beaten and be a friendly summon that can hopefully make their game less frustrating. To be honest, this is the only real “grinding” that I enjoy. No Maidens? I rushed through the game (from a story standpoint, not an exploration standpoint), so I did sacrifice her to become Elden Lord.",0.711487650871276855

I've done speedruns, challenge runs, the whole lot. When I call things in Elden Ring hard, it is NOT for lack of experience.) Elden Ring has a lot of minor flaws (sparse armor early game, some jank w/ teleporting field bosses, boring crafting, boring catacombs, the hundreds of spirits and flowers I will NEVER use), but I can basically forgive all of those, because the game (at the start) is honestly incredible. However... about halfway through, the development budget totally falls out, and every area is now a ten-mile corridor full of enemies that can 2-shot you *alone*. The placement feels almost random at times, and it gets tilting fast. There is an entire lategame subcontinent with *three* graces. That means, if you die to any of the 2-shotting wolves or patrolling archer hordes, you have to cross the entire thing again. The two areas after that are nearly as bad, to the point that sprinting through is the only viable option. Once again, I can totally forgive some bad levels! Every game has some... but the larger bosses feel like pulling teeth. Trying to beat every shardbearer (major boss), you'll find at least two that are literally unplayable. One early game that is easily cheesable, Starscourge Radahn, and one lategame that is entirely unforgiveable, Malenia, Blade of Miquella. The latter has an attack that is almost entirely undodgeable, with a half-second tell that only helps if you're 30 feet away, and takes me from 1500 to 0 in a second. After all the shardbearers, you get the semifinal boss, a damage sponge who can 1 or 2-shot with every attack, who has an entire phase where every attack is a room-filling AOE, and who then phases into a grab machine that will instakill you with its comical grab hitboxes and 12-attack combos. If you can beat the AOE/Grab-machine, you get the honor of fighting the final boss... which has a fun-if-unfairish first phase, followed up by a ridiculous final phase full of camera-breaking nonsense and a very childlike idea of ""Cool Final Boss"", which singlehandedly ruined my belief that the writers had ANY plan for this endgame. Like, we had a cool final boss in phase one with Radagon, but they got swapped for ~the idea of the elden ring~ like a ridiculous Soul of Cinder parody. Once the comical, humiliating damage sponge is taken care of, you get your pick of ending! There are effectively two, with one obviously bad third choice where you literally burn the entire world, because why not, and overall, we leave with very little idea what any of this was about, what our ending choice even means for the world, or what we've really done in the first place. Yay! Game done! After 90 hours, I feel totally numb and ambivalent to this! There are a lot more things to talk about, like how finnicky quests become with an open world, but fuck. I think the worst thing I can say is that I spent all of Elden Ring planning new runs and build ideas, and now that I've beaten it... I just feel tired... and let down. (But the OST does 100% slap, and I do love Torrent, as well as a lot of the NPCs. 100% A+ for them, you can hug a woman, which is more than I can say about my love life) --- EDIT: There is actually precisely ONE thing from the comments I'd like to add to this review. If you see anyone saying Elden Ring has 'six' endings, let me break them down for you. There is the basic ending. There is the true-ish ending. There is a bad ending. Then, there are three more endings. These are all the basic ending with a color filter over the cutscene and a single word of dialogue changed. Nothing new is added, and they amount to: Become god, become god but bad (grey), become god but VERY bad (red), and become god but catholic. These feel like extremely late additions, and they only highlight how vapid the difference in non-apocalyptic endings really is. They're meaningless enough that Elden Ring *basically* only has three endings. Also, I only learned after writing this that the game features a field boss who is literally the first shardbearer! The dude from all the trailers just... shows up in the field with a different name, and you fight him again. Elden Ring's copypasting problem is seriously everpresent, and I've not touched on it as much as it deserves, especially considering how mandatory catacombs are to the game. It's fun for one run, but by the second playthrough, I'd really prefer if spirit tuning components were just distributed throughout the fun parts of the game.",0.703542351722717285

Rise, Tarnished, and be guided by grace to brandish the power of the Elden Ring and become an Elden Lord in the Lands Between.",FromSoftware Inc.,ELDEN RING,"FromSoftware Inc., Bandai Namco Entertainment","I would give a mixed review if I could. Elden Ring has a lot of issues that could be a deal breaker depending on your preferences. I'll list the positives first and then the negatives. Positives: The story is quite good, if you're willing to put in the effort to read all item descriptions and carefully listen to all NPCs. The world itself looks fine depending on how good your PC is. The unique bosses are mostly fun to fight and the combat is as it always is in a Souls game. There’s a variety of weapons and spells to use which gives a lot of choice in playstyle. Negatives: The largest issue with Elden Ring is also its main advertised feature: the open world. The open world is too large and there is too little to do there. There are so many open fields with just 3-4 crafting materials in it and nothing else that is worthwhile. It feels incredibly empty. Furthermore, there are way too many copypasted structures in the open world. Every church, every shack, every ruin is the exact same. The bosses in the open world are usually copypasted and you’ll encounter the same bosses in multiple areas. Sometimes even a “unique” major boss is repeated in an area where it makes little sense. The open world also causes many issues with NPC questlines, which are harder to keep track of than ever and the use of a wiki is pretty much required to follow them. While the world does have a lot of dungeons and caves to find, these have many of their own issues. Anyone familiar with the Chalice Dungeons in Bloodborne will immediately recognize that the dungeons in Elden Ring are much the same. They are all copypasted and just not worth the time. There are around 4-5 unique dungeons which you’ll then see repeated literally everywhere. It’s so boring going through the same dungeons over and over again. The same enemies can be found in all dungeons as well. Mines will have the same miner enemies; catacombs have either skeletons or gargoyles. There’s no variety at all. The boss at the end of the dungeons is copypasted and the same bosses can be found in different dungeons, just with health differences. The reward at the end is not worth the time in most cases either. This leads me to my next point, which is that the performance of this game is really bad. If you have an older CPU, be prepared to run into a ton of issues that are caused by the game not using the threads of the CPU properly. Invisible enemies, the world not loading correctly, bosses not appearing, these are all things that can happen because the optimization of the game is so bad. The online connectivity of Elden Ring is also incredibly poor. I played Dark Souls 3 on release and never experienced any of the problems that Elden Ring currently has. Playing co-op with more than one person will result in one of the summons randomly disconnecting very frequently. Playing co-op with one person is more manageable, but there will still be random connection errors, even during boss fights. The connection problems also affect invasions, with invaders randomly encountering connection errors. The last thing I want to mention are the current balance issues with sorceries (require intelligence) and incantations (require faith). Many powerful sorceries can be found from the very start of the game, making an intelligence build the easiest way to play from the early game onwards. Sorceries can easily deal twice as much damage as incantations. Good incantations can be found only in the late mid game to end game, and even then, they still aren’t as good as sorceries. The early to mid game has around 5-6 sorcery-focused areas, while incantations have absolutely nothing until the late mid game. These balance problems could be solved down the road, but currently it really sucks that one build is clearly inherently better and easier than other builds. Conclusion: If you don’t care about copypasted structures, enemies, and bosses then you might still enjoy Elden Ring. You should also forget about long co-op sessions or consistent invasions. However, for me these aspects ruin some of my enjoyment of the game and make me hesitant to recommend it.",0.695738315582275391

Everything boils down to one problem - there is no meaningful randomity here. Sure each run is composed of randomly chosen maps, but they mostly play the same. Sure, there are about 40 types of enemies, but stunlocking is the best way to beat every single one of them. Sure there are different skills, but they all boil down to just changing some stat. The final nail in the coffin is the system of permanent upgrades, persisting between runs. Instead of mechanics to learn there are stat bonuses to grind out. Progressing in this way feels empty, and with time kills any challenge the game presents. I've played other roguelikes where each playthrough was set apart with different mechanics requiring different playstyles. Here it's always the same - just get in range of the enemy and smash the attack button until it dies (also dash a bit). It gets boring fast.

It isn't that I disliked the game. It just felt meh. I loved the rest of Supergiant Games' games but Hades just isn't gripping me. SGG is known for their art and music but Hades feels like a step down in both. Especially character designs. Compared to the huge varied cast in Pyre or strong and purposeful characters in Transistor Hades just looks off. The music is also nowhere near as impactful as the older games, often times getting lost under everything else going on. Story was also a huge highlight of SGG's older games. Bastion and Transistor told their stories well with hidden tidbits if you were willing to work for them. Pyre's story changed based on your choices and the outcome of your matches whether they be victories or defeats. Hades hides the entirety of its story behind grinding. Tiny snippets of the plot and character interactions open up after every death and it doesn't feel good getting like 5 or 6 lines of dialog every 20-50 minutes of gameplay. All other SGG games were in original universes but Hades is their first set in a somewhat familiar setting. I think this was a mistake. They lean on people's general knowledge of Greek Mythology as a crutch to building their world but the whole thing seems like their deepest dive in the mythologies was a few wikipedia articles. It makes a lot of the character interactions either hollow or just silly. Characters chide you that it is impossible to leave Hades when Orpheus, who as a mortal walked all the way to Hades' throne and then all the way back to the mortal world, is in the same room. They even reference this story with Orpheus' interaction with the character. That leads us to the gameplay. Honestly this has never been SGG's strong suit. Bastion's gameplay was fine, Transistor's was an interesting gimmick that got old quickly, and Pyre was not good when it wasn't being a visual novel. Hades lives in a space between Bastion and Transistor. The combat is a mash up between the two with most of the weapons having their default attacks ripped straight from those games, the spear is just the pike from Bastion with the spin move added, the adamant rail is just the repeater + mortar. The hammer upgrade sometimes help change this up though. That isn't the only stuff recycled from their older work. In the first biome almost all the enemies are just reskins of enemies from primarily Bastion though the cluckers from Transistor are there too. I only really harp on this because in the past SGG has said that they always wanted to move forward and make new experiences and Hades contradicts a lot of that. As someone who liked Bastion's combat I started off liking Hades' combat as well. The problem comes in that Bastion is constantly moving forwards while Hades keeps making you start again. It becomes tedious. You fight the same small handful of enemy types in each biome and more or less the same even smaller handful of bosses on repeat, and no the Furies aren't different enough from each other to feel like fresh fights. That doesn't include the armor mechanic. If you aren't lucky with your upgrade rolls then getting into a room with high HP enemies with armor is just a slog. Armor is essentially a second health bar that takes less damage unless you have the right upgrades and makes it so they can't be flinched. It doesn't make the fights harder. It just makes the fights longer. In my opinion the upgrades don't add enough spice to make each run different enough. Most upgrades are just adding a rider to you current moveset. Your attacks push enemies farther, inflict a status effect, do more backstab damage, etc. Only the previously mentioned hammer upgrades change how weapons handle and even then it doesn't always. This is a lot of negative but I wouldn't have picked it up back up after my first 3ish hours of playing if I completely hated it. It can be enjoyable in chunks of 1-3 runs at a time but it is too tedious for more than that. There was and is still clearly a lot of work put into this game but I feel like a lot of it is misplaced. Cutting down on the tedium should take precedent over romance options. TL;DR Step down from SGG's previous work but if you liked Bastion and/or Transistor for their gameplay over their story or music maybe try it out. PS. I know it is ""early access"" but the core of the game is obviously complete and we are far enough into development that they are really only going to be adding content on top of what is already there or minor tweaks. Things aren't going to be massively overhauled.",0.701656639575958252

Good learning curve, new weapons unlocking, learning each biome, and the game is gorgeous. And then I beat the boss. And after that the game sadly turns into the most boring grindfest I've ever seen in a decent roguelite. Same levels, same bosses, no surprises, no alternate paths, no secrets. Just do it over and over again for a couple of bloods and diamonds in order to upgrade a couple of things, and then do it again. I'll recommend the game for the first part (up to killing the end boss) because the game is incredible and rewarding then, but after that I'll say this is a very poor roguelite with regard to replayability. The content just gets old very fast. The only new stuff is dialogue lines, and while they may lead to a few new gadgets, we're still talking about a few more dozens of runs just to see it through, replaying the exact same content. Coming from Isaac and Dead Cells, this is seriously lacking and does not provide enough content to justify the tons of runs on the very same content required to unlock the aspects and advance the stories. Supergiant has once again created a game with masterful narrative, visuals, music, voices, story, gameplay, but they have not handled the roguelite aspect very well. So: a very good and short action game, or a very limited and repetitive roguelite. The devs have specified they don't want to add new biomes (only the 4), but I'll still keep my fingers crossed for some magical new content with the stable release.",0.692760586738586426

In theory this is fine, but in practice for this game at least it means that you will progress faster by intentionally dying or giving up; actually trying on a run is often not in your best interest if you want to progress the story, which passively discourages you from actually playing the game. -- To add to the above, there are things like character dialogue. Most characters can only be spoken to once between runs, but to max out your relationship with them, you have to speak to them dozens of times. Supposedly you can speed this up by starting a run and immediately killing yourself, but this is just trash gameplay (in fact, it's practically an absence of gameplay). - The between-run upgrade system is grindy to a fault. I'm told this gets better after you beat the game once because it will unlock more easily farmable materials by way of run modifiers. THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING AVAILABLE FROM THE START, because run modifiers are something that would help the game be less samey and grindy right from the get-go. - Upgrades (called ""boons"") are seemingly designed to prevent you from ever feeling powerful. They very rarely synergize, and the ones that do are often designed to only interact with only one or two other specific upgrades (for example the Zeus boon that makes your lightning ricochet more. That synergizes with the maybe 3 specific other upgrades that are also from Zeus that give you lightning). This adds to the repetition between runs in a huge way, because upgrades are basically just static things and don't dynamically change the game to any great degree. -- The enemy armor mechanic seemingly scales to your damage as well, so even if you do get some 1/1000000 fun run, you will still have to spend whole minutes chipping at enemies with yellow health bars. Edit: This is incorrect, and I was misinformed on this point. I stand by the enemies with armor being way too damage-spongey, but scaling is not actually present to this degree. - There is really only one boss per chapter, and the boss is pretty much always the same. This isn't technically true because a couple of the bosses have slight variants where they'll use one or two attacks more often, or in a differently shaped pattern, but it never really changes your approach to the fights. This means in addition to the samey floors with the same enemies you've already seen dozens of times, you are guaranteed to see the same bosses every single time, ensuring every run feels exactly like the last. To its credit, it has a good deal of positives: - Excellent art and style, no need to elaborate further as this is self evident - The different weapons you can choose before your run are meaningfully different and do offer wildly different playstyles, most notably the bow and the gun - Bosses are fun to fight, at least the first few times (but as said in the negatives, they get repetitive fast. The bone hydra for example was a blast the first few times but now I consider it the easiest boss by far and dread having to spend time fighting it). - The gameplay for the most part is fast and snappy, allowing for fun combo-oriented play styles. The big exception is any enemy with armor, which essentially requires you to play much safer and slower as they can always attack you. In theory, you could dodge them every time and keep attacking them even if they are armored, but if they have any kind of AoE attack or there is another armored enemy nearby that can get you from behind this just isn't viable (and there WILL be more than one armored enemy very often), meaning you have to play poke-and-run until the enemy armor is chipped off. - Run modifiers apparently exist. I've not reached them, but I would bet you could comfortably do it within 15 hours if you're decent at video games. From what I've seen of them by googling, they don't seem to change the game to such a degree that I'm interested in continuing just for them. Again, I think that the game would have been better if these were available right at the start, because as-is the game is much too samey. All in all, I give it a thumbs down if you're in it for the gameplay. The game doesn't feel like it was designed to be a roguelike, because roguelikes shine when the gameplay is notably unique from run to run and when the gameplay is more focused on runs themselves rather than the upgrading in between, and none of that is the case here. I wonder what the game would have looked like as a more linear experience.",0.65593254566192627

Don't get me wrong, this game has an amazing story, cool characters, great lore, ton of content, beautiful stylized graphics... but gameplay itself is honestly very basic and bad, and as somebody who finds gameplay to be the most important part of games, I feel compelled to talk about it. While the combat itself is not awful, per se, it's just not good enough to make me even want to actually play this game, much less To put it simply, the base gameplay loop is just a lot of button mashing. The most prevalent strategy is to spam dash and attack. You may say ""Just don't"". However, in this game, enemies are quite tanky, so it feels like you're putting yourself at a disadvantage by not using this tactic (because it helps that much). Sure, there are different weapons and playstyles, and god's gifts that add some flavor to the gameplay, but that feeling that all you're doing is button mashing never goes away. The only weapon that I found to be unique is Bow (and supposedly a Gun, but I haven't grinded to it yet) in the fact that, well, it's a bow, and you have to charge it before each shot. However it still relies heavily on button mashing. I have few issues with gameplay itself as well. There are few. Firstly, why does your character completely stops when attacking? In a game that is so fast paced, it makes combat feel rather awkward, and only facilitates supremacy of ""dash and attacks mashing"" tactic. This is such a small thing, that when added to other can lead to bigger frustrations. Call this a nitpick, but to me this feels like a small issue, that, like a broken immunity in a living organism, when present makes other issues worse. The other issue is that It's really hard to see anything. While the game is pretty, everything is just so flashy that most of the time you take damage, you don't even know what hit you. Adding this to whole spam thing, and you can take whole lot of damage from seemingly out of nowhere. And, if I'm being honest, the biggest issue for me is that this whole button mashing deal just makes my hands tired (and head, because it feels like you constantly have to move), which is probably my biggest issue with combat. Technically, you can unlock weapon aspects, which supposedly do add quite a bit of weapon variety (and are kind of cool, not gonna lie), but you need to do quite a bit of grinding to unlock even one for a single weapon, which brings me to another issue I have with these game. The game is very grindy, not only when it comes to stats, but also with its story. Let me explain. Everytime you die, there's always at least one NPC that has new things to say to you. Which is great in a sense that there's always something that makes your death worth it, and if you are as fascinated in ancient mythology in media as I am, you're gonna have a blast. However, the issue is that you get those story moments and character interactions in such tiny drops, that it leaves you wanting more, which combined with the gameplay issues I mentioned previously, only makes me frustrated because if I want to learn more of a story I have to engage with the systems, which makes me hesitant to even play in the first place because of the same gameplay issues. To put it simply, you can't escape the gameplay if you only care about the story. This paragraph is more of a response to some people who claim that ""who cares about gameplay, if the story is good"". I mean, sure, if that works for you, but why would I bother playing a game if I don't want to engage in gameplay? What stops me from just watching some playthroughs on youtube, and not bothering with anything else? Just some food for thoughts Anyway, there are few other small issues, which I just want to point out are not necessarily good, nor bad. Certain base elements that don't unlock until awhile in your game. While this specific example doesn't affect the game much, there are other similar base elements that are hidden behind play time, like, for example, character stats, which you can upgrade to become stronger and get higher chance of finishing the run. Which is not a bad thing, but they add to the overall grind, and make you feel like the game doesn't want you to be able to finish the game until you upgrade those enough Again, I just want to be clear, I don't think those design decisions are simply bad and need to be removed or anything, but I just want to give different perspective on why these aspects are not as simple as they might seem. The last issue I have with this game is absolute lack of accessibility options. This is bad. This game has God Mode, which increases your damage reduction by 20% when activated, and this number increases by 2% every time you die, up to 80%. This is it. This is better than nothing, of course, but where's everything else? There's no colorblindness options, no hold button to continuously attack button, or even basic text size increase. Nothing. With recent leaps in accessibility it's really hard to excuse this lack of anything in a modern game. For how much deserved criticism Last Of Us 2 got, its accessibility options are fantastic. Even Dead Cells, game sharing similar niche, recently got a fantastic update adding ton of good accessibility options. This is not even a nitpick. You know how you can fix not seeing anything while in combat? Add outlines to everything, and allow us to customize them. Accessibility options are useful even to regular players. The lack of those in this game is just puzzling. Anyway, here's my review of issues this game has, which I couldn't not mention. I probably need to add this last paragraph to all my reviews, but I don't like redundancy, so it will stay here. In case this review gets picked up by some steam algorithms or whatever, or some youtuber makes one of those dumb ""reacting to negative reviews"" videos, let me tell you this: The reason why any game should be suggested to criticism is because no work of human can reach perfect state, yet it does't mean we should stop trying. Any game has flaws, and the way each developers tries to perfect their product is what I find fascinating in this industry. Of course, in the recent years games have become more of a source of income, business, so to say, yet games are still an art form, and most developers do try to make a great game, which is why these sort of critiques are important, I think: To show the way these games can be improved. Frankly, I can't say that I have any authority to say that this review is anything more than just my opinion, and if it will resonate with anyone, but I still found it in me to write it, since I find the discussion itself to be most important part of these, since it generates different views from different perspectives, and damn me if those discussions aren't great to be a part of. People who are the most negative usually are the ones who care about the game the most. If I didn't care, I would drop this game and forget about it. Yet here I am.

The TL;DR is that while some parts of the core gameplay loop are satisfying, it is overall repetitive and there is way too much emphasis on meta game resource grinding- most of which is borderline purposeless. At its core, Hades is a isometric action brawler. Gameplay is generally similar in format to Bastion or Transistor: you have a big room filled with badies and you use a small variety of weapons and abilities to dispatch of them and move to the next room. There are roguelite elements which can change the way you brawl in subtle or sometimes dramatic ways but for the most part it's a 1, 2 punch of mashing your light attacks, special attacks, and timing your dodge to avoid enemy attacks. There are traps and other interactables you can play around with but after a few hours you get the gist. There are quite a few interesting perks (or 'boons' as the game calls them), as well as 'accessories', that can be fun to discover and some choices you make affect how you build your loadout from run to run but this is where the core game starts to fall away. Most choices you can make are based around the meta-run pseudo base-building resources (of which there are more than 4 different kinds) which are used in between deaths to purchase extremely minor upgrades for your character, new weapons/variants, unlock mostly useless accessories through story dialogue, add rooms to future dungeon runs which should be a given in a game like this, or purchase pointless gimmies like seeing your previous run stats or changing color palettes or background music for your homebase. This creates a continuous 'grind' during runs that don't actually affect your current run and does very little to add to future runs. It makes a good chunk of time repeating the same rooms/fights seem mostly purposeless and the times when the game takes away your choice in lieu of these resources feel underwhelming. This wouldn't be so bad if the gameplay loop was overly fun but after the first 4 or 5 runs you've seen every enemy there is to see and you've got the pattern for room-midboss-room-boss memorized. Worse still, as you get further into the dungeon stages, the fights become longer and less interesting. Instead of challenging enemy behavior, Hades simply adds 'armor' to most enemies making them more tanky with a second health bar and spawning increasing numbers of them. About the point you have to start taking boons specifically to make reducing enemy armor mandatory, you realize the game is simply padding for time instead of making you interested in discovery. There are other complaints that can be made: like how your character seemingly 'sticks' to walls making movement near impossible, or how room traps can feel cheap based on color palette choices, or how the layout of some rooms (including an early boss fight) is just outright bad, or how bosses constantly require inane movement, but realistically Hades is fun for a good chunk of time and most of those things can be overlooked. Still, the excitement slowly drains and what you're left with is a very pretty but simple button masher. That may be enough for most people but for hardcore roguelike/lite fans, the lack of depth is killer.",0.633350789546966553

If you're here for a visual novel or a Supergiant game, go ahead. If you want to play a good roguelite, look elsewhere. --- Hades is very interesting; it’s made me rethink the way that I measure out the quality of games. It’s made me think about what a “good game” truly is. It’s made it much easier for me to examine and understand why I hate dating simulators and visual novels. This insight isn’t because it’s a 10/10 masterpiece - I’d say it’s a solid 7/10. Maybe a 6/10 when I see the same room layout for the third time that day, or the blandness of all the weapons starts to make combat run together into a mush. It instantly drops to a 3/10 if my hammers (little upgrades that the game is very stingy with) give me boring options. Roguelites (and roguelikes even more so - more on that later) heavily depend on gameplay variance, and Hades very often struggles with this. There is a good reason, though: Hades is a Supergiant game before it’s a roguelite. This isn’t what I was promised, but it’s what I should have expected. I haven’t played any other Supergiant games, but I’ve heard plenty of people talk about them. Story, characters, art, atmosphere, and sound. These are the most important parts of a Supergiant game, and Hades has it in spades. It has a lot more, even: the similarities between Thagreus’ and Hades’ voice patterns; the ways that Elysium slowly introduces you to the mechanics of the bossfight before you actually fight them; the furies changing up just as you get used to fighting Meg; Hermes’s keepsake; the voice acting; the character design...I could go on. All this to say that Hades is a supremely crafted game, and every second of care - every drop of passion - is magnified in its presentation. It’s a middling roguelite, though. Over my time playing through this game, I’ve noticed that there are two qualities that a roguelite/like needs to be a good game. It’s a bit convoluted, but it’s the best way I can think of to clearly explain what’s wrong with Hades: inter- and intra-run variance. “Intra” refers to games changing up gameplay mid-run, while “inter” refers to changes between each run. Both of these are necessary to make a good “roguey” game that doesn’t end up feeling like Malt-O-Meal in your brain. Usually, roguelites will focus on inter-run variance, while roguelikes will focus on intra-run variance. Hades follows this rule in an interesting (but ultimately ineffective) way. While most roguelites have you collecting power-ups between runs, driving you to move forward through a feeling of getting stronger and improving via gameplay, Hades’s primary motivator is story. Your relationship to the various characters throughout the world can be advanced in a visual novel-style progression of “giving them a universal love currency.” You can only give one love potion to each character (that may or may not show up in the hub) per run. As you progress in the game, the story of each character slowly unfolds, masterfully giving you a glimpse of not just the characters you talk to, but the world that the game takes place in. I’d actually like it if the other driving forces of variance weren’t utterly bland. There are six different weapons, each with four different variants (aspects). This should (in theory) provide 24 different ways to play. In practice, most of the weapons feel like aspects of some common-ancestor blunt object, and the aspects themselves feel like banal power-ups. Power-ups have their own issues, though. First, there are the hammers: the only source of meaningful intra-run variance. They’re heavily RNG gated - and even then, they only spice up the gameplay on occasion. Often, they’ll simply boost your numbers or give you something boring like being able to attack repeatedly with a button held down. Then there are the boons: the “real” power-ups. They almost never meaningfully change the way you play the game (and even then, when they do change up gameplay, they often serve to make it more boring, such as Ares’s “Doom” mechanic), and on most occasions act as increases to numbers accompanied by fancy graphics. That’s not even the real issue with combat, though: the real issue is that weapon progression is paced awfully. The process of farming up the item required to unlock the different aspects of each weapon (Titan Blood) is like pulling teeth. This would be fine if each weapon had enough depth to warrant waiting that long to unlock new abilities, but they’re mind-numbingly flat. The optimal techniques and strategies for each weapon will usually reveal themselves by the third area of your first run with the weapon or the first area of your second run. There are two possible reasons that titan blood is as scarce as it is; to pad out play time, or to scale with the progression of players who aren’t as good at the game. With the quality and forethought on display for the rest of the game, I’m more inclined to assume the latter. As I said before, Hades isn’t a bad game - it’s just a mediocre roguelite. The story is swiftly losing my interest, and a dull curiosity (along with a feeling of “maybe it gets better soon and I can write a better review!”) is currently the only thing keeping the game installed on my computer. Perhaps there is a fantastic and intricate roguelite buried under another 30 hours of trudging, but the opportunity cost is too high for me to care. Like ""The Witcher 3"", his game isn’t made for me, despite being masterfully crafted. As of writing, the top review on Steam starts: “I thought I didn't like Rougelike's before Hades... This game has completely changed my opinion on the genre.”",0.620234429836273193

My problem is that in my opinion it's a huge step back from previous games (Pyre, Transistor, Bastion). Even though I truly enjoyed characters, gameplay and art, there are so many things that made my experience just frustrating. So lemme go through the goods and bads that I encountered: - Gameplay is fun and allows for very interesting combinations! Was great way of spending free time. - There are lots of grinding options, which is great for people that like that part of game. - Setting this game has for a rogue-like is great! It justifies so many mechanics that other games don't have. - The story requires a huge amount of grinding to unlock and when you finally reach them, it's not really satisfying for all the effort you have to put in. - 'Dying mechanic' that is a huge part of this game doesn't have the same impact as it did in Pyre, where if you lose you actually feel like it has some kind of impact on the game and leads you to different endings. Here it just punishes you and makes you reach the end after longer time. - Game felt repetitive, because of not many rooms/enemies. After around 20 runs I already knew what would happen on each level. - (important one for me) All intriguing moments of the story were just hidden behind a dark screen and some text/noises that would kind of describe the situation. It really broke my immersion. I really hope that SGG will put more effort into that part in Hades 2 - Music was always a huge part of SGG games, playing in most important moments that added depth to their games. Here 90% of songs are played in a lobby area and even though they are beautiful, they potential is not fully used. I still love SGG and will play their games, but I wholeheartedly dream of Pyre 2 to come one day, as Hades just doesn't seem to be my cup of tea. Glad that so many people enjoy it though!",0.602226614952087402

On his way out Zagreus must defeat hordes of undead baddies, evade traps, and overcome fierce bosses to reach the surface and be welcomed onto Mount Olympus. Hades is the forth game from the indie developer Super Giant Games. Deep down it is a hack and slash. However Hades uses a rogue-light design over their more traditional forays found in their previous titles. I'll go through the gameplay, narrative, and presentation. In a way Hades plays much like Bastion: your character wacks baddies with weapons, dashes around to avoid damage, and use the environment to get those sweet explosion kills. It plays simply with tight controls, which is exactly what you want in a rogue-light so that complexity can be piled on as you play. However there is not much complexity to pile on. Boon, favors from the gods of Olympus, are your main sources of upgrades- they tweek your attacks, dashes, or give you passive abilities. These upgrades, however, are rudimentary. They include simple things like boosting weapon damage while adding a status effect to hit or adding damage to Zagreus's dashes. Not to mention there are relatively few upgrades- around 100 or so, many with simple variations on a theme. In addition some just don't mix. Get another boon that impacts your weapon swings? Well toss or keep; because Zagreus's dashes, weapon, call (ultimate attacks) and casts (a ranged attack), can only have one boon applied to each of them. Which is a shame because it could spice up each run. Speaking of the runs, they get old and quick. Only four areas, five bosses, thirty enemies, and a slim amount of room layouts is all you get to play with. I mean slim room layouts- you will hit the same room with a different enemy arrangements several times in each area. This culminates into repetitive and grindy runs. I feel that is the antithesis of the rogue experience. Every run should be like cracking a pack from your favorite trading card game for a draft game- you know what could get, but you don't know you're going to get right now, and you got to work with what you get. You have to remain flexible but also call on your experience to play your best. Yet if every card is basic with nothing that makes a *THUD* or makes you go “Oooohhh!”, why play? Where is the excitement of diving into the game again? The rogue sub-genre allows a dev team to flex their creative muscles- allowing for items, abilities, and interactions that just wouldn't work in a traditional styled game of its parent genre. I feel SGG missed this memo. As such Hades feels conservative in its design for a rogue styled game. Instead of the chance to experience wild upgrades and crazy upgrade combinations there is material collection and incremental stat increases. Dullsville. Yet Hades is great on all other fronts. SGG brings their attention to narrative to fill a game with life and drama. Hades's court is filled a number of characters- each with their own wants, needs, flaws, and questions. Zagreus is a genuinely likable guy. He routinely shows concern and will always lend an ear to his fellow court members. Its a positive character trait to bring to the forefront. I just really like that. The story gets more gripping as it progresses as more questions surrounding Zagreus are added and answered. The game's presentation also looks fan-tas-tic. The character illustrations are wonderfully composed. The colors, poses, facial expressions, and details enrich each diety with life. The backgrounds themselves are also lovingly done with many details like hands reaching from pools of magma and smattering of coins around alters. The voice work is impeccable. From Hypnos's mocking tone to Poseidon's buttery voice the actors fill the many, many, MANY lines with character. The sound and music are also well done. Darren Korb supplies his talent once again with progressive tracks featuring acoustic and electric guitars. A good listen- even you don't buy the game. In the end Hades is a great idea with poor execution. Yes it has engaging narrative, yes its sounds great, yes its damn pretty, and yes its a functional action game. But the core of its rogue gameplay doesn't bring anything exciting to the table. Hades just feels padded out with all the needless grinding and material collecting. If you enjoy grinding, Hades will sate you. No doubt about that. But if you want something with a bit more meat and content look elsewhere.",0.600129187107086182

I've never been a fan of rogue-likes, but I was hoping Hades would be the exception with how well received and highly rated it is. Now, before you mald out and type a paragraph in the comments calling me names and insulting my family, let me explain why I feel this way. I will start with things I do enjoy. The art is beautiful and well designed in every way. There is a lot of visual stimulation within every environment with plenty of small details to catch your eye. The gods and other characters all look great, with different visual charms about them that makes them almost immediately recognizable. I cannot fault Hades for it's aesthetics at all! 10/10 The lore is deep and immersive. With something as monumental as Greek mythology, the developer had a lot to work with and craft their own narrative and world from it. I really like the dialog and the immersive conversations that happen between you and the gods or between themselves. I think Supergiant Games did a fantastic job with this! 11/10 Now then, let's get to the crux of it. I found the combat to be way too repetitive and boring. I find myself using the only two viable moves necessary to clear rooms, spamming attack and dodge over, and over, and over again. Quickly wearing out my thumb in a few runs. You almost get in the rhythm of rolling your thumb between X and A just to clear the rooms quicker while dodging projectiles, traps and damaging pools. I still haven't found a good reason to use B unless you build your boons around it. With only six weapons to choose from, I didn't find much of anything mechanically interesting. Half of them have very similar move sets so they don't really feel unique. Generally speaking, three of them are melee, three of them are ranged. Not much else going on there except being able to throw the spear and return it and dash with the shield, making the shield feel just like the bow. Again utilizing only two types of combat mechanics to me. You might ask ""What suggestions do you have then, smart guy?"" How about some poison weapon that trails behind Zagreus that deals damage over time? How about a casting weapon that creates streams of ichor that can be used like a flamethrower? How about a discus lightning weapon that chain attacks enemies? I just found them too limited and uninteresting, with the exception of the fists which I actually enjoyed using and got the farthest with. The bow auto-locks onto any enemy it wants if you're holding attack down (for max damage), which is annoying when you're trying to hit the enemies that revive in a room full of other mob types. The reload mechanic on the gun is just a time waster, although I understand you can get boons to help mitigate reloading as much or even at all. Traps are a pointless health-drainer that only exist for you to spam dodge more. If you clear a room in the Asphodel area and try to enter the boat to the next area while mistakenly standing on lava, you take damage that you cannot move off of until the animation finishes and moves Zagreus to the next area. Minor complaint there, but still unnecessary. I don't like how this game is supposed to be played around specific builds, like focusing only on getting your X attack boosted, or only getting Y boosted, rather than making an overall strong well rounded character. This is very similar to how Risk of Rain II plays, you have to build your runs around very specific items and if you don't, you cannot make it far. There are many guides online for ""best boons per weapon"", which I always find extremely boring to use, opposed to winging it and learning as you go mixing and matching different combat techniques with different types of boons. It always felt like a gimmick to me, like if you don't play it one specific way you can't progress. It just isn't viable to mix and match. I'm an open-minded person, I REALLY want to enjoy this game but I find myself just not having fun. I'm an achievement hunter, so I try to maximize my completion percentage, meaning I will inevitably continue to play to get the achievements. Counterproductive, maybe. But bigger number better person, right? Maybe over time as I ""get good"" I will change my opinion on this, but as it stands, I just don't see it.

As an action roguelike video game, Hades fails to provide a good experience. The mechanics are really tight, the controls are near-perfect, but for some reason Supergiant has decided to over-balance the game at the expense of what makes roguelike games so fun. The fun part about doing more runs in Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon, or any other roguelike is finding builds and combos. You are always searching for that ""overpowered"" build. Not every run ends in some game-breaking combo, but it's part of the fun to play the RNG-lottery game and chase some hilariously broken build. You can't do that in Hades. In fact, Supergiant *actively* patches and nerfs boons (upgrades to your character) if they are even slightly too strong. The result is the same bland level of character strength every single run. You can never stray outside of the narrow bounds of what the developer has deemed ""acceptable"" DPS for your character. It gets super obvious when you start leveling Poms (upgrades to your boons) and they have diminishing returns after a few levels. Why? If I focus on a build where I *only* upgrade my Zeus attack, why diminish the upgrades? Why not let me become overpowered? Why actively nerf powerful boons? Why balance a single player game like this? Who benefits from nerfing a single player game? Secondly, the game lacks a few extra floors. There are currently four floors, and the last one is very short. There are no alternative paths or secret areas to reach. Each run is almost exactly the same, apart from some minor randomization with bosses and room-types. I recognize the production value of this game makes it difficult to make new enemies/floors/bosses, but I can't discount this drawback. It's possible the developer has some good reason for making these changes, and I ultimately had a decent experience engaging with the story, but the reason I bought it was for a fresh new roguelike experience, which I did not receive. If you want a nice little story to play through in ~40 hours, this is a game you should play. If you want a fresh new roguelike experience, I do not recommend it.",0.583504736423492432

It pains me to see that improving the restocking is nowhere to be seen in the game's roadmap. That has to be one of the most frustrating parts of the game, IMO. At first, you don't have many items to take care of and re-stock, but as your store grows and you start acquiring licenses, you basically need to have every single item in stock, otherwise customers won't find them and complain. When you acquire enough licenses, holy sh!t, the amount of buying and restocking that has to be done makes the game a burden: - Buy 10 boxes of whatever items. - Store all of them one at a time. - Buy 10 boxes of whatever items. - Store all of them one at a time. - Buy 10 boxes of whatever items. - Store all of them one at a time. - Buy 10 boxes of whatever items. - Store all of them one at a time. - Buy 10 boxes of whatever items. - Store all of them one at a time. Ad infinitum It usually takes me 10-20 minutes every day just restocking and I don't even have many licenses (2 or 3). I refrain from doing anything else in the game like upgrading the store and acquiring more licenses, just because I think of the toll that managing that stock will have on me. It stops being fun after a while. I really wish I could focus on expanding my product selection and expanding and organizing my store to my liking, but I spend most of my time restocking... Dev, PLEASE make this a priority in your roadmap if other players feel the same way. Customization and making the store bigger is useless if you have to spend a real time hour every day just restocking. There's a few ways I could see improvements in that area: 1. The re-stockers SHOULD BE ABLE TO pick up the boxes that have been bought and place them in the rack by themselves. This could be optional or an upgrade to the re-stockers, so that players can manage the stock themselves if they so desire. 2. There could be an auto buy feature, so that you can schedule item purchases for the next morning; 3. The limit of buying 10 boxes at a time makes no sense, unless that is for performance reasons; 4. Picking up a single box at a time, going to the street, then to the storage multiple times is really cumbersome. Maybe consider picking up multiple boxes at a time; 5. There could be a feature to buy the exact amount of boxes the racks are missing of a specific item. There are just some of the things I can think of right now, but they would GREATLY improve the experience of the game and allow players to focus more on other aspects of the game.",0.842488110065460205

I'd recommend waiting for 3 or more updates before actually getting invested in your little shop. This are some fixes I think the game DESPERATELY needs: 1. The ability to carry things outside of boxes. 2. A way to automate restocking. The AI worker helps during the day, sure, but at night/in the morning, you end up spending 30+ mins irl just running back and forth across each isle and into storage to check what you're missing and where, memorizing a mantra of items that you then input into the computer (10 things at a time), and it's just too tedious when you've bought several licenses and have 50+ items to keep track of. You should be able to buy an ipad to buy things from in front of the shelves, yes, and then also an upgrade maybe that lets you keep a goal of how many items you want there to be in the shelves+storage, and the game can then automatically reorder these for you in the night/in the morning. 3. Fix a bug that happens when you move things from one shelf to another, and the restocker guy or some clients get stuck trying to buy the item that was previously there. I think it happens if you empty out a shelf and put in a different items while your AI staff is on the way to restock the previous item. (Which brings me to, there needs to be a button or something to ask my staff to not do sh=t while I rearrange products on the shelves. The amount of times I wasn't fast enough to take the tag off of a shelf I was going to use for a different product, only to see the staff fill it up again and throw away the box I could've used to empty it, is TOO MANY TIMES, WAY TOOOO MANY.) 4. Omg please let me pain the walls, the floors, let me add a name outside or maybe buy posters around town to advertise my store more. It gets so dull looking at the same yellow wall and wooden floor and grey ceiling forever. 5. It's so easy to miss the messages clients say when they're looking at products that are too expensive. If they're out of your range of vision then you're out of luck. Even when they are, they go by so fast you might not have a chance to read it out fully. I need there to be a better summary at the end of each day where they specify what products they complained about being too expensive. Also the message that pops up in the morning stating what prices went up or down needs to stay for longer, perhaps as a little box on the corner of the screen I need to click X on. Maybe do this for clients' comments as well. Then, and only then, consider adding cool stuff like: 1. Your town looks so nice, why not add a delivery function to the game where you can do deliveries yourself/hire someone later on, with a little map of which house you need to go to? It would be SO cool. 2. Thieves.... I mean, it's an instinct everyone has playing this game, everyone wonders ""should I be concerned they're stealing from me?"" The answer is no. But it should be, not yet. Maybe a messaage pops up on the third or fourth day saying a supermarket nearby spotted a thief, and you should be careful too. It can be as simple as installing sensors at the door to tell you if someone is stealing. Or maybe it could give more purpose to the lamps you can buy, which is that, if your store is too dark, you're more vulnerable to people stealing. It can also be a motivation to not leave your store unattended for too long (make it more challenging to restock during the day once you have staff helping you at the cashiers and such). Maybe there's also a risk the stuff you ordered will be stolen if you leave the boxes outside for too long. Then later on you might be able to pay for a guard. 3. A bank, so that you have to visit it every so often to get change for example. So that you don't just have infinite amounts of bills and coins, which feels so unrealistic. 4. Carts omg. It would be so cool to have carts stationed outside that npcs can use instead of only having the paper bags they have now. But then you need to be constantly clearing them out from the cashiers and bringing them back outside.",0.756950259208679199

The main thing is that this is not even a Supermarket Simulator at all, in fact, its a stock control simulator. Would make more sense calling it ""Warehouse Simulator"". The reason I say this is hard to explain, so here is a real situation to help understand: In Supermarket Simulator, you purchase stock, stock your shelves and a rush of customers come in and buy all these products. Now the big issue here, is that EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER BUYS LIKE THEY ARE DOOMSDAY PREPPING. It takes you 20/30 minutes to buy everything, restock the shelves, throw away the boxes, until you're finally ready to open, and one single customer buys 8 boxes of spaghetti and 6 packs of coffee. You also can employ staff! Sounds amazing right? The issue here, is that the staff sit on a till, and that is quite literally it. They do absolutely nothing else. There's no order in the game at all, just buy boxes and put them on the shelves. You can't move individual products, you can't decorate your shop, and there's 2 fridges you can buy and 2 shelves. That's it. Again, I understand it is in early access, but its getting disgusting that these low effort, unity asset flip games are gaining as much traction as this one is getting, perhaps with the assistance of purchasing reviews. Wait a year or so before even thinking about spending £10 on an unity asset flip. This one isn't even done well.",0.681117773056030273

They exhibit extreme unprofessionalism and treat individuals who contribute new content to the game like trash. I took the initiative to develop a dedicated website offering useful information and tools for fellow players, which was well-received. However, despite reaching an agreement with two moderators on the official Discord server allowing me to mention my page once a day without posting a link, I was unjustly banned by the developer from the server, citing 'excessive self-promotion' as the reason. It's important to note that my website solely focused on game-related content, serving as a promotional tool for the game itself, with no personal gain involved. I created this site out of genuine passion and interest in the game, only to be met with a ban. Moreover, the developers' strict censorship extends to discussions about fan-made modifications and expansions, which are integral to many games. Users are cautioned against discussing modifications, despite their significant contribution to the gaming community. This unprofessional behavior from the developers threatens to alienate the community and ultimately undermine the game itself. In conclusion, while the game offers an exceptional experience, the developer's handling of community interaction and content creation is deeply disappointing and may ultimately harm the game's longevity and appeal. For this reason, I will no longer support or engage with the game. It's alarming to witness how people who genuinely enjoy the game and seek to contribute content are treated here. I have never encountered such treatment in any other game.",0.617548048496246338

""Shelf re-stock simulator"" would be more accurate. Because that's all you're gonna be doing after a couple of hours. Granted, the first 1-2 hours are fun and feel fresh, everything after you hire your first cashier is literally just running around with boxes restocking shelves. Just to make this very clear: you literally do NOTHING else than restock shelves. NOTHING. You keep running from the parking lot to different shelves and that's all there is to the ""endgame"", which you will find yourself in after literally 1-2 hours. Until there is some bot added to the game, who does the restocking of shelves, the game is unplayable like. The reviews are certainly not justified considering the 1-2h of content before it all gets so mind numbingly boring that i'd rather go work in a nearby supermarket and earn minimum wage for getting spat at by angry customers than keep playing this unpolished pile of dogsheet. To elaborate a bit on the general gameplay cycle: The farther you get, the bigger your store becomes, the more shelves you get, the more shelves you have to solo restock every morning before you open up. At this point in the game I hated restocking so much that I literally bought enough shelves to have 3 slots for each type of inventory item. Guess what: buying more shelves doesn't make the problem go away, it makes it worse! So now I restock my 3 shelf slots of pasta, meaning 3 boxes of pasta, each containing 8 small spaghetti boxes that end up on the shelf, and they don't even make it half way through the day until the market is out of product. So you'll have to re-order more spaghetti during the day with 100 customers in the store and literally rush to the shelves 24/7 to restock spaghetti and salmon and apple juice and cleaner and w/e you can think of. It is literally the most stress inducing experience I ever made in a game and I had to stop because I started feeling really sick and numb. I already made appointments for burnout treatment because this garbage game left me mentally unstable. TLDR: DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP UNTIL IT HAS MORE CONTENT THAN 1 HOUR (everything past the 1 hour mark is literally just filler content that's not meant to be played yet because there are no NPCS doing restocking of shelves so you're basically playing amazon warehouse worker sim at this point, featuring all the negative consequences of that) The only pro of this game is that it is now finally possible to get burnout without earning any actual money in the process.

Now, as of right now everything is open and in plain text format and easy to edit and look through if you know what to look for. But, once I started finding errors and easily fixable bugs and started to share them on the discord that's when one of the devs took it personal. He and started deleting my posts and said ""Should I consider adding a control that blocks the game when you edit the save file externally? This way we could get rid of spoilers, wydt?"" First of all its a supermarket sim, what spoilers? XD Second, doing that would severely cripple and slow down the development of the game as that would cause the community to find bugs A LOT slower.

I was from Dota 1 for like 3-4 years before Dota 2 was released and it didn't caught my attention to adapt the new theme of it. Dota 2 is a great game, an awesome game. I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game people, so team work is a must (unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around). Monster gamers are real. Dota 2 has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that.. THE COMEBACKS ARE REAL!!! This game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. A mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten. All in all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.

Please don't play it. There is NOTHING more satisfying in this world then winning a 1 hour + length match in this game. Both teams get extremely personal with each other, both teams doing everything in their power to make sure that time spent belongs to them, there will be a couple of central characters in the match who just dominate the battlefield and both teams are doing everything to make sure that character can come through and do their job. Fuck sex, fuck money, fuck fame. In that one moment, when you win, you feel like the whole world is yours and the people you might have never ever been friendly with, suddenly can turn into great friends the moment after that victory. Its incredible and I haven't seen a game that is able to create these miracle situations as often as this one does. But thats the whole problem with this game, to get that situation you need a well balanced match, you need decent team mates, you need personal will power and skill, and you need time. If ANY of those things don't line up, you are in for a massive shit show. I can't even tell you at this point how many terrible matches I have had. Its terrible for your mental health. Even when you finally get decent at the game, there will always be better people and you are still playing a team game. Its depressing and you constantly have to be confronted with that playing this game. In a way its humbling and great for self growth, but in another way its absolutely unhealthy and that kind of mental torture is something people shouldn't subject themselves to. Even after reaching immortal multiple times there is still so much room for improvement. As I grow older I just see myself losing access to that kind of time constantly. In the past 5 hours of free time was nothing and I wouldn't grow tired of it at all. But now I have responsibilities and people needing my help, a 40 minute match is something daunting when you get to that point.You just end up wishing you could pause the game like with single player games or wondering if you couldn't spend the hours in Dota to finish up playing other games you wanted to play. This isn't just a long game, its an infinite game where you are the deciding factor on when to stop, depending on the type of person you are, that stopping point might take a long ass time like it did for me. Conclusion When I started this game I was a mess of a person, I had barely any friends, I was terrified of talking to other people on the mic and the only thing I cared about was winning and getting better. Once I got even a little better I would tell people what to do in a horrible way and expect them to listen and even thank me for the insults I threw at them. I learned from all of that and improved myself as a person, I got a lot more empathetic, learned how to talk like a heartfelt leader, learned how to socially make fun and talk to people and got much better at critical thinking and problem solving. But as I look back, I just wonder if there wasn't a better way to go about it, words can't describe the extreme lows Dota can put you in. Dota shaped me as a person and helped me a lot, but for everything it helped me with, it equally took away a lot as well. No matter how much I love this game, I could never recommend this to someone I don't know very well and that I KNOW could handle this game normally. This game has the potential to take so much from you. Play it at your own discretion and make sure you know what you are getting yourself into.",0.907473385334014893

I had achieved what People find very hard to do in their Lives. I had quit Dota for over 2 years. It was a MISTAKE RETURNING to the game. But here I was, teaching a friend. It really felt like DOTA had become a very player friendly in the past 2 years. It took a day or two to get back to normal DOTA playing habit. I was playing UNRANKED and It felt good, I was on a roll. Playing tens of games a day. Slowly realising it's pulling me back. And then all of a sudden I had an urge to press the RANKED button which had a new Roles option. I played my first ranked game as a Shadow Demon (A support), won my lane and surprisingly had a narrow win. My team did not know how my hero or the items worked. The feeling was different. At first I just thought these people in my team are just miserable turd burglars but No I was wrong. They made what would be a simple game to an absolute sh%#hole of a game to be in. If I say that the next few games had given me the trashiest people in the entire universe, it would be an understatement. I HAD NEVER FELT WORSE. First, they cannot be reasoned with. Secondly, the amount of flame, rage and incessant ramblings I discovered in these games was overwhelmingly DEMEANING. People flaming to the point you have NO CHOICE BUT TO ABANDON. I stopped my RANKED venture and went for a NORMAL one and boy did it kept getting worse. I'll tell you guys it's EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to enrage me, but here I was getting angry at these creatures, Raising my voice to my newbie Friend who had now loved the game but eventually agreed It was time for us to stop. In just a couple of days I went from being a perfectly reasonable, calm & friendly personality who would encourage people if they are playing bad to being an absolutely miserable person with anger issues screaming and yelling etc. 2 days Ago I uninstalled the game. I still don't know why I have these mixed thoughts. I have spent a decent amount of time to understand how the game mechanics works and quite honestly would like to summarize that I have wasted an important part my childhood, jeopardised my mental health on several occasions, had a fight with my father over this stupid game and overall took a giant dump on my Life and guess what I still love this game. I wouldn't wish this on anyone and would sincerely recommend every player to take care of themselves, Don't waste too much time on this game. If you win or lose doesn't matter, take a break, go out for a walk. Call your family & friends. Confirm that you aren't that same miserable person from that game that stupid game you play. The community has somewhat grown up from 2014. My rank opening game. A bloodseeker screaming on his mic and typing a rant every 2 seconds for 45 minutes flaming his teamates. I still remember how shi%%y it felt to this day. It was not worth it back then, Its not worth it now. And to any person coming here...

Over 8k hours logged (not even joking). And I'm gonna tell you: at this point, the game's just not worth playing anymore. I think it hasn't been worth playing for a year or two now, but I'm only just starting to realize it. It breaks my heart to say that, but that's just the truth of the matter. ===== The Good ===== Dota 2 is a wonderfully complex and intricate strategy game, with mechanics that are honestly rather simple, but require a steep learning curve to even begin to master. The graphics are solid. The voice acting of the characters is thoroughly enjoyable. The capacity to play this game any way you please, so long as you win, is one of the most exciting and fulfilling aspects of it. What's more, the fact that it's 100% free--so long as you don't feel a deep, unyielding need for cosmetics--makes it almost the perfect game. Almost. ===== The Bad ===== Matchmaking is an absolute dumpster fire. In my over 8,000 hours of playing the game, I have not even ONCE griefed my team or intentionally fed. Team play and integrity is that important to me. Yet, be that as it may, I routinely now get matched up with griefers. People who throw a tantrum and start intentionally dying to give the enemy team free gold and experience. Or buy up all the wards and place them around fountain / in the middle of trees, where they give no vision. Or just AFK jungle and hoard as many neutral items as they can. Or even just hide in the trees to soak experience so that they don't get an abandon, but otherwise contribute nothing. This occurs in both unranked matchmaking AND ranked matchmaking. Every single day. Years ago, this would ALMOST NEVER happen in ranked games, and only SOMETIMES happened in unranked games. Now it's absolutely rampant. To make matters worse, ever since Valve implemented a ""buddy"" score--that is, an internal rating to judge who would be friendly to new players so that they had a better experience--the vast majority of my games have me teamed up with people vastly below my skill level. By its very nature, Dota 2 is a competitive game. For me, the attraction was the ability to test myself and push myself harder, so that I might face better and better opponents until I felt challenged and fulfilled. Years ago, I had that. Recently, however--that is, the past two to three years--my experience in that regard has been a massive pile of flaming hot garbage. Fewer than 10% of the games I play feel genuinely challenging. The remaining 90% or so of the games I play are just steamrolls because the people on my team or the other team are just so bad, comparatively. Until Valve implements some sort of actual controls on the matchmaking for competitive play, I can't recommend this game in any sort of good conscience. It advertises itself as a highly-competitive team game, yet it's clear to me that their matchmaking system does sweet FA to actually implement that experience. I once loved this game, and thoroughly enjoyed the competitive atmosphere it had. Now, it just pisses me off. If you're just looking to goof around, then this is the game for you. However, if you're looking for an actual competitive experience? Look elsewhere. Somewhere along the line, this game's system for evaluating skill levels and pairing people up accordingly fell apart, and the developers either don't realize it, or don't care. EDIT: Apparently, a lot of pros on the scene agree with this assessment. I didn't even realize it until doing some searching after this review, but according to syndereN, the amount of griefing in public matches is ""the worst ever been in 15 years, and it's not even close"". https://dotesports.com/dota-2/news/synderen-dota-pubs-worst-theyve-been-in-15-years",0.883557498455047607

To whom it may concern.. Uninstall this game and run for your life before its too late. Maybe the reader now giggling and drawing an image on his/her mind says this guy is a nerd. No im not, I'm a fitness guy with good shape studying engineering, which I had a social life in the past . I lost too much things on my life most of them are privacy/personal things not going to write them down but one of them is my education 24 years old still studying engineering because of this game. If you are going to say that you can manage your day between playing ""DOTA"" and studying or working you are wrong because the average match time is 35 min *only 1 match. So 35 min × 3 games per day = 105 min. Not mentioning that some games exceed 1 hour if both teams played well. Please take this as an advice from 24 years old guy who has been suffering for 3 years because of this game I sucked on education you can be better than me and quit, I destroyed my dream and now im trying to bring it back wish me good luck. Please this is not a ""joke post"" and this advice aiming on teenagers who want to achieve their future dreams just don't play this game its fuckin AWESOME game but you have to pay your life for it. Your choice life or Dota and this is not a joke if you throw my words away just please save my comment on your favorites and come back after 3 years don't cry if your life got ruined.

However, I feel for it and bought the ""Digital Premium"" edition, hoping to future-proof my purchase on my chosen platform. That was a mistake. First, to get it out of the way, the base game is solid and very worth the $70 it costs. The voice acting is top notch, the new engine looks amazing, and the quality of life improvements remedy most things that made this game feel dated. If I were just reviewing that, 8/10. But, SKIP THE DIGITAL DELUXE OR PREMIUM editions. First of all, the promised ""soundtrack"" is just a glorified music player written in the game engine that won't even allow you to start another game while playing. Want to listen to the tunes in the car? At work? On your phone? Nope. Install it on your computer, sit your butt down, and play it there and nowhere else while doing nothing else. Then, a month or so later and what happens? Episode Aigis gets announced as part of the ""expansion pass."" Episode Aigis is also known as ""The Answer"" from Persona 3 FES and was included completely free on that game. I thought: yeah, they won't make it free. But, surely those of us who dropped $100 on the premium edition of the game will get it for free right? Ha, no. Look, you'll have fun if you get the base game.

So far, I've been disappointed. I'm fine with some things not being animated cutscenes that were in the original, but in key moments, like Orpheus awakening, not having the hand drawn animated cutscene feels awful. Sure, they had a rendered cutscene, but it just isn't the same. The remixed songs have mostly been not great, which is a shame because I really enjoyed the original's soundtrack. I'm mostly fine with the art direction, however, not drawing the protagonist's clothes feels lazy. There's just a shadow over the clothes. Also, there still isn't a definitive way to play this game, which a remake should have fixed. There's no female protagonist option, no The Answer, and no Desert of Doors. Junpei doesn't sound as good or as young as he did in the original game. I'm going to continue to play the game because the frustrating thing about FES and the original was not being able to control your party members and this game gives you that, but so does Portable.

Usually, people forget that the whole point of remake to make parts of the (or whole) game which were bad or just outdated - good. Not to just rerelease already good/almost perfect/PERFECT in a new cover with making what was good - worse and add a shit ton DLC, just to get more money again from the hyped audience (hello, RE4R). In P3R case - we can clearly see it's a #2 category. For that REMAKE, SEGA asking us to pay... 70$! For NORMAL edition! I want to remind you - it's a RE-MA-KE! It's not a new story with a new cast of characters, locations art style and etc. To remade something is MUCH cheaper and faster, than to make something new from the scratch. Second big problem - for 70$, you won't get nor FEMC, nor The Answer. Some people can say like ""It was bad, so I'm glad it was cut off from Remake"" - and yeah, it was bad from the gameplay perspective - so may be that's why it really needed a remake in the first place, more even than the main game does? Atlus can also release The Answer later as a PAID dlc or as a part of P3ReReLoad - and there is Tweet from a ""leaker"" who previously leaked P4A and P3R releases (https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1752552368384704671?s=20) - just proves that Atlus is planing to release it as a paid DLC. And the third big problem are day 1 DLC (shitload of them), and that's not only a simple remodeled characters but persona's with unique skills (aka p2w personas). The funny part is - they can't even sell you all personas from 1 game in 1 pack but 2 packs with personas from P5. Last but not least - BGM music sets - for 5$ you'll get a COUPLE of songs from P5 (and a couple from P4 if you reordered - almost at the same time TEKKEN 8 came out and gave us 99% of franchises OST for free with ability to customise it. Just saying. There also already questionable changes in the remake - like, why did Atlus change music from the original (which already was a pure perfection) for something what is definitely sounds worse than from original (Mass destruction)? Hope there will be mod which restores old music and save only brand new songs. And can be even more questionable gameplay/story/charachters/woke localization (https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_61f81cf3-3f99-4e98-ab02-8d91ee1be665) and other changes in the future. P.S. No Brand New Days in Main menu, you can't choose other sports clubs except for Track field and Art club. Also game looks pretty cheap in terms of graphics (+- like P5 on PS3) and if you wan't to disable motion blur or TAA you need to do it through the game files.",0.620521664619445801

I am a mom who likes to unwind and just chill and is not competitive and usually plays solo. However, last week, I was banned for no justifiable reason. When I tried to log in and received a message that I was banned, I was shocked. I filed a ticket, received a generic copy/paste message that I was 'cheating' with no further explanation. I have NEVER cheated in a game, including this one. And when I responded to the ticket asking for further elaboration, I have gotten nothing. No further responses. I know for a fact no investigation was done because if it had, they would have found I wasn't cheating. I HAVE NEVER CHEATED. Yet, I can't get a response or any explanation from this company. I have spent hundreds of dollars for it to be taken FOR NO REASON. I am furious that this is how innocent players are treated and I would warn you not to spend a dime on this game since it can be taken from you in a moment for no reason with no recourse and no explanation.",0.9393959641456604

The company literally hates its player base by refusing to listen to feedback on how to make it better, obvious the dev's don't really play themselves or they would know. They shut down any criticism and leave bugs hanging for months if not years and ask you keep spending money. The cash shop is ridiculously over priced and the crate system and gems are as most games, a rort. New dungeons that should be included with new map DLC are sold to you as micro DLC's like a damn EA game. They flat out refuse to fix the PVP content and fix the issues in cyrodiil and server lags. The fact they out right silence criticism tells you all you need to know. I'm sad that this game has gone in this direction of instead of making great content they just add more crap to the cash store when game content is what will bring players back old and new. I've spent a shameful amount of hours in this game since launch so this is not a drive by thought. Bottom line, they don't care about game play, only cash shop.",0.922685921192169189

No game subscription required.",ZeniMax Online Studios,The Elder Scrolls® Online,Bethesda Softworks,"I love this game, but I think it's time that I air my grievances. As you can see, I have spent quite a lot of time in ESO. I have probably played ESO more then any of its developers, and all we as a community ask from them is that they listen and understand our problems. So, that's why I am writing this rant as a means of informing the devs. However, any ESO dev has probably already stopped reading and decided to play a match of Tales of Tribute, or, as I call it, a waste of time. Speaking of Tales of Tribute, to even play that, you need too pay for it, so let us discuss... 1: A history of free and paid content in ESO: April 2014 - Release. May 2014 - Added Craglorn Zone - Free June 2014 - Added Veteran Crypt of Hearts Dungeon - Free August 2014 - Added Ability to dye armour - Free September 2014 - Added Upper Craglorn and the Dragonstar Arena - Free November 2014 - Added Veteran City of Ash Dungeon - Free Febuary 2015 - Justice System and Champion Points Update - Free March 2015 - Tamriel Unlimited released, crown store introduced. August 2015 - Imperial City DLC - $25 (Now Free) October 2015 - Orsinium DLC - $30 (given away for free as a daily reward once) March 2016 - Thieves Guild DLC- $20 (given away for free once) May 2016 - Dark Brotherhood DLC - $20 August 2016 - Shadows of the Hist Dungeon Pack - $15 October 2016 - One Tamriel Released - Free Febuary 2017 - Housing Update - Free? (Houses cost gold/crowns) May 2017 - Morrowind - $40 (Now Free) August 2017 - Horns of the Reach Dungeon Pack - $15 October 2017 - Clockwork City - $20 Febuary 2018 - Dragon Bones Dungeon Pack - $15 May 2018 - Summerset - $40 August 2018 - Wolfhunter Dungeon Pack - $15 October 2018 - Murkmire - $20 (given away for free as a daily reward once) Febuary 2019 - Wrathstone Dungeon Pack - $15 May 2019 - Elsweyr - $40 August 2019 - Scalebreaker Dungeon Pack - $15 October 2019 - Dragonhold - $20 Febuary 2020 - Harrowstorm Dungeon Pack - $15 May 2020 - Greymoor - $40 August 2020 - Stonethorn Dungeon Pack - $15 November 2020 - Markarth - $20 March 2021 - Flames of Ambition Dungeon Pack - $15 May 2021 - Blackwood - $40 August 2021 - Waking Flame Dungeon Pack - $15 November 2021 - Deadlands - $20 (Free for limited time if you owned Blackwood) March 2022 - Ascending Tide Dungeon Pack - $15 June 2022 - High Isle - $40 August 2022 - Lost Depths Dungeon Pack - $15 November 2022 - Firesong - $20 (Free for limited time if you owned High Isle) March 2023 - Scribes of Fate Dungeon Pack - $15 June 2023 - Necrom - $40 March 2024 - Scions of Ithelia Dungeon Pack - $15 Now, if my math is correct (which it probably isn't), buying all of the DLC's at launch, and not counting limited time free events, you will have spent around $690. Some will argue that you can just buy the monthly subscription, but why is it that games such as Wow and Warframe can give away their new and old content for free? Sure, ESO DLC's have one major quality that others lack which likely contributes to the price, full voice acting, however, they use the old Bethesda trick of hiring the same actors to voice countless NPC's but, whatever I guess... I'm not asking for everything to be given away for free, I am quite literally asking for scraps that are several years old. You can however, purchase things from the crown store with gold. This is done via in-game gifting. So, you would send a player gold, and in return they will spend their crowns to gift you the crown store item that you want. This is not without its problems, with the biggest obviously being scams, but, getting DLCs this way is fine... I guess. However, if you do get scammed, you will have to contact support, and speaking of support... 2: Zenimax as Developers and as support: While I do somewhat respect @Bethesda_Kraken for responding to reviews, I personally think that no response, is better than a copy/paste generic response. Anyway, let me walk you through communication between the players and Zenimax, in my own experience. Experience 1: 1: Ignore the steam forums. 2: Several players post a bug/problem, in my case, a bug regarding a lead. 3: Players say that the lead is not dropping and that it is probably bugged. 4: Zenimax says that it is not bugged, and that it is very unlikely that something like this would be bugged. 5: Time passes. 6: Zenimax says that it has been bugged, and that they will work on a fix. The fact that this has happened several times is hilarious. Experience 2: 1: Players ask for something meaningful to be added or fixed. 2: Zenimax releases an archeology/antiquity minigame. 3: Players once again ask for something meaningful to be added or fixed. 4: Zenimax releases a card minigame. 5: Players complain. 6: Forum thread locked/deleted. This game has come a long way in 9 years, and I don't want it to fail or get worse, but for many like myself, we play this game because we like the world of the Elder Scrolls. So when the Elder Scrolls 6 is released, why should I stick around and play this? When I compare this to something such as Warframe or Destiny 2, which also had rocky starts and have changed dramatically over time, I can't help but feel disappointed and cheated. Both of those games are free with zero subscriptions. and yet I feel that they are less predatory than ESO. Anyway, I will continue to update and change this review over time, thanks for reading. Edit April 2024 - Recently, a few ESO DLCs were given away for free. On one hand, this is great, but...... Why not just make these 8+ year old DLCs free and/or part of the base game. They did it with the Morrowind DLC. For example, WoW makes it so that when the new DLC is released, last years one is made part of the base game. I'm not saying ESO should do this, but nearly decade old content should should just become part of the base game, instead, they do this limited time FOMO crap...... It's all so tiresome... TL;DR: Game is pretty good, and yet horse amour has better value.",0.915858864784240723

No game subscription required.",ZeniMax Online Studios,The Elder Scrolls® Online,Bethesda Softworks,"I have played this game for the past 3 years and would not recommend it. I would like to start with the positive aspects first. Pros [*]ESO has great graphics for an MMO, and the environments look amazing. Its possible to use Reshades to make the game look even better to look at. The cities are really big and its possible to visit most the interiors of most buildings. [*]The world feels very alive as there are players everywhere, in every zone even the most outdated ones. It makes it easy to find people to do activities such as world bosses. [*]In game community is often helpful, lots of people have helped me out when I was new, but the endgame community can be toxic. [*]The dungeons are fun and have some cool mechanics. They each have a story in them and also each dungeon is unique and the bosses are quite challenging. I had a lot of fun playing them with friends. Neutral [*]The story and questing is one of the biggest aspects of ESO, and I have mixed feelings about it. Some of the zones have really interesting and engaging story lines, such as Grahtwood and Orsinium, but I found most of it boring. The main story quests of most zones are ok doing it once but it lacks replay value since there are no actual choices you can make that affects the story to a large degree. Most of the choices left to the player are really small and they mostly show up in side quests. I don't like the side quests most of the time because its often about helping someone who really doesn't have any proper background and isn't interesting, and the quest bosses are highly repetitive and too easy to kill. [*]The soundtrack is good I guess but I feel that the best tracks are remastered from the previous Elder Scrolls games. I found the combat music to be pretty annoying. Cons [*]I found the combat to be awful, mainly because of animation canceling as well as the combat feeling floaty. So the animation canceling is when you can perform a light attack between abilities. All skills have a one second GCD, but light attacks are on a different timer, which causes this issue. Animation canceling increases DPS by a lot and its essential in endgame content. It requires a significant amount of skill to perform correctly, but it just isn't any fun. What's more is that it makes the character look like they're having a seizure, and it clearly isn't an intended feature. The game makes no mention of this anywhere, but if someone wants to do any endgame content they need to be able to do it, as otherwise most guilds will not consider them. Another issue is the champion system, its meant to be the endgame progression system. There are 810 points to obtain in total, and they are obtained by just gaining exp. But the system is boring and it just offers something like +1% damage or +1% magicka recovery and stuff like that. There are no class new abilities added with this system and it isn't really fun for endgame progression. [*]Classes feel too similar to each other. ESO has 6 classes, but there exists two variations of each class, magicka and stamina. The stamina version wan't intended by the developers(I think) because there currently is stamina sorcerer and stamina necromancer which don't make much sense. But due to the way abilities work it was found that stacking stamina in builds results in being able to do good dps as well. The problem is that every single class has the same types of abilities, just with different colors and effects. Every class has a similar ground based DOT, one spammable, one buff which grants increased damage, one defense ability which boosts armor and so on. When performing dps rotations, every class plays almost the same due to this. But some classes are tweaked every patch which keeps shifting the meta, so one needs to have every dps class available. [*]PVP is too laggy and not fun or balanced. The PVP in this game was intended to be a major aspect, however these days it seems to be neglected. The game was supposed to support 200 vs 200 battles, but even with 20 people on the screen it starts to lag and sometimes gets disconnected. FPS also drops, however the game doesn't use a lot of system resources either. Its also unpredictable to tell what enemy players are casting because of the combination of animation canceling and lag. The PVP isn't balanced in the sense that sometimes one faction has way less players than the other one. Also some classes are just better in every way than other classes, and some sets are overpowered. [*]Endgame trials(raids) are also laggy, and the trial design is bad in my opinion. There are only three or four bosses in each one of them, and there is too little trash mobs in between bosses. Bosses have some interesting mechanics but it just isn't very fun due to the poor combat, lag and low fps. Trials also don't drop very powerful gear which is worth chasing after or any cool cosmetics. [*] Too much focus on crown store. The game is very hard to play without the monthly subscription as inventory space is highly limited. Even after subscribing, too many things are pay walled, such as mounts, pets and housing. The monthly crowns which are provided are so little that its possible to only buy a pet or a costume. The game has 95% of mounts pay walled with no other way to get them. The better mounts are kept in the loot crates which use another currency system called crown gems, and the coolest mounts are called as radiant apex rewards which cannot be obtained with even crown gems and must be gambled for. Housing in this game is really fun and its possible to make all sorts of structures, but its so ridiculously overpriced, the best houses are crowns only, and even then the best furniture is sold exclusively through the crown store. The problem with this is that there is very little incentive to play through the game and collect stuff. And now even skill lines and skill points will be sold through the crown store. Skill lines are an important part of the game because they have important passives which are needed in more difficult content, but they are grindy and boring to level up. It literally takes a 100 hours to grind all the skill lines such as mages guild, undaunted, psijic order and to collect every skyshard to unlock all the abilities on one character. Many players have asked for it to be account wide, but in the end the solution is sold through the crown store. So the crown store isn't limited to cosmetics only, there are game play impacting items as well. I would call it pay 4 the convenience 2 win or something like that( p4c2w :)). I wouldn't recommend this game due to these reasons, as the game is slowly being designed with only the cash shop in mind. I've spent a lot of time and money on this game and I regret it a lot. I mainly maxed out my all of my characters skill lines and skyshards, as well as spent many hundreds of hours becoming a master crafter. Almost everything is available for purchase through the crown store these days, its so bad that its possible to become a master crafter in just a couple of minutes with the crown store. I would only advise this game for TES fans who may be interested in playing the story casually, because as an MMO its just not that good for the amount of time and money that it asks.",0.90827631950378418

Because the developers are more interested making money via re-skinning the same old crap in the crown store, than they are in fixing the many, many bugs. Newer content comes out? So do new bugs. Patch updates or maintenance? More new bugs. Fix certain bugs? Break something else instead. And not fix it for ages, if ever. Because, y'know, crown store shinies more important. Add to that the incompetent and clueless customer service (e.g. expecting me to acknowledge T&C/TOS in a language that was _never_ selected as my own; ridiculously long gaps in addressing forum concerns) and the ongoing price for having such basics as a crafting bag, etc. Why keep paying over and over for a game that is this broken, with crappy developer service, when there are other games you can enjoy for a one-off price?

I've played WoW for 14+ years. I'm not new to MMOs. I can tell you, without a shadow of a doubt, that the developer of ESO, Zenimax, is putting this game on maintenance mode. If you want to play this game, just know that it is not as good as it used to be, because they have shifted a lot of their dev team off this game. They are currently working on another MMO and ESO has been put onto a minimum effort content cycle of wringing money from people's wallets whilst they go full steam ahead on another game. New content is half-assed and designed to get you to spend money for minimal effort. Not only that, but they've started putting very overpowered gear into each new expansion/DLC to get people to purchase them, and then they nerf those items within a few months. It is downright scummy. The game itself is fun and the base content is plentiful, but if you want to do more than casual leveling you have to pay for a subscription as it functions as a solution to every problem that is introduced if you want to do more than questing. Professions? Get a sub. Endgame? Get a sub. Participate in auctions and trading? Get a sub. Housing? Get a sub. Make your character(s) look cool? Get a sub. Should mention how bad their forum is as well. They have a salaried group of people whose sole job is to police their forum hardcore. You cannot post anything negative about the game there. Ever. You will get your posts removed/edited by their mod police, if not get outright banned. I wish I was joking. Just browse through it and look at how many posts get edited by ZOS mods lol. And if you want to know how Zenimax treats their playerbase, let's look at something that happened last year in 2021: https://old.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/pfgvvn/entire_raid_group_banned_for_reporting_a_bug/ They will outright ban people for reporting bugs. This is not the first time, nor the last time, that Zenimax has banned people for bug reporting. REPORTING. Not even taking advantage of a bug, but just experiencing it and then reporting it, like they are told to do. And bugs in this game are so frequent that you have to tiptoe over eggshells lest you might get banned. Currently, there is a re-occurring bug with daily login rewards that can give the reward multiple times. People have accidentally gotten multiple rewards because they don't even know it's a bug. Many of those people ARE GETTING RETROACTIVELY BANNED. For something that this inexperienced dev team can't properly fix. Talk about sad. I've made a lot of friends in this game and had a ton of fun, but it is absolutely not a game worth investing in anymore. Just find something else. Also, that 21 million players thing is a load of shit. Their highest player peak was under 50k and the daily peak is like 20k and declining. And looking through the recent reviews on here, it looks like ZOS may be buying positive reviews. Accounts that have not even setup profiles, but go out of their way to review a single game? Yeah that's not questionable at all. Edit 2 months later: My friend with 12000 hours was permabanned. No prior warnings, straight to permanent. He had pretty much stopped playing the game already, so kind of weird to get banned when he had not much game time. He also wrote a negative review on Steam, so it's not surprising to come to the conclusion that my friend was revenge banned by ZOS for the review. I'm probably up next for a ban.",0.876332521438598633

I've invested enough of my life into this game to give a truly honest opinion which is as follows; In the beginning I was hopeful and defended this game even when I knew it was heading in a not-so-great direction, blindly devoted to the hope it could be something better, with the removal of the subscription and the prospect of One Tamriel it seemed somewhat hopeful. Over the years, the game devolved into what one might only call a Cash Farm, The only feature of their game that actually has never broken, and works as intended, is their micro transaction store known as the Crown store. Where you can buy player housing costing a premium price that could net you a brand new release game (15k Crowns, you wont get much change back from £100), or many recoloured re-skinned variants of the same 6 or so mounts and a bunch of other assets they have used on the various content they have produced. Most new content seems to be made of older assets, slopped together in a means to pander to non concurrent players, just to lure fresh players into the cash farm, rather than fixing long, long standing issues for current players. Cyrodill the always laggy open map PvP *cough* and we can't forget the Dungeon Finder, one would think fixing one of the only core utility enabling players to do dungeons together in an mmo, would be more important than making some new re-skin of a pet that does nothing for the low price of 2000 Crowns (£18) or so would be more important, not to them, apparently. So no, I strongly do not recommend The Elderscrolls Online.",0.873172223567962646

Looking back at the past there is a night and day difference. Previously when there were issues that the community presented to ZOS they were met with appropriate response. Even looking back at the past few years it is quiet clear that ZOS's mean focus is how can they can get Microsoft the most dividends. Instead of improving performance whether is is Cyrodil, Imperial city, or veteran trials. Take for instance the final boss in the Vateshran hollow hunter's grotto, Rahdgarak has been bugs for months at this point. It is very well known in the community that he is broken and nothing has been fixed or even addressed by ZOS. This type of bug is the prime example of what type of business model ZOS has. Ignore the few long term customers because they aren't going to leave, and focus on the new players who are dumb enough to spend tons of cash on a game. Then once those new player reach the end game content they realize that most of it is unplayable due to bugs. How long did it take for Zos to fix the poison on Veteran Sanctum of Ophidia, or the bug in Veteran Rockgrove.",0.872767090797424316

Its been a year of the devs not caring about the players and squeezing them out of every cent, im tired. Broken updates that literally destroy the combat mechanics (for example, not being able to use your shield as a tank) take almost a month to get fixed, but they do still put out a new pet or cosmetic almost every week. Yeah, its not the same team, but if they put the money that goes into a bullshit amount of cosmetics into hiring another dev, thatd be better. but they dont. They act like they care about their community but their coms are almost non-existent and they even have the gall to say the players are being unfair when they call them out on broken updates that nerf everything but the new 2 or 3 things from the new expansion, so that you go and buy it to get the new powerful items. So, to summarize: -Pay to win in the form of artifacts that are released ABSOLUTELY OP -No care about the mechanics (Its like the eighth time they do deep changes to the whole combat mechanics, its been years of beta testing for them and they change and change. -No real new content except for quests. We get a new zone (if you pay for it of course, and you also have to pay your subscription if you want to play the game because if you dont your inventory will fill in 10 minutes, the game becomes a logistics nightmare and you spend more time organizing than you do playing, and you OF COURSE also pay the game, which I think is worth it for the content it offers, but when you add the subscription and paying for expansions, they are nickel and diming every player and its wrong) but thats it. Its been so long since we had a new class.. But they do have the time to make fucking cosmetic animations to sell you even more. -PvP is absolutely destroyed, even tho they fixed some issues with the servers, its just wack and the balance is non-existent -PvE is oriented to catch new players, hook them up, then take a hot dump on their throat when they reach end-game. I'm not saying there isn't toxic end game players, there is, but they keep dumbing down the game and making years worth of effort null and void with changes that NO ONE even asked for, they say they do them because they want the game to be more inclusive and to help new players, yet those same changes complicate things for new players too (Go check the forums on the first combat update of high isle) -They dont care about destroying the balance of the game if they can sell a new toy.. They will put out those aforementioned op items while nerfing everything else, even if it means destabilizing everything the players have learned until then. -They do not seem to have a QA team. EVERY. SINGLE. UPDATE. BREAKS. SOMETHING. I'm fucking tired of having to go check which character I wont be able to use each update because they either made a skill not work or bugged it so hard that if you use the character you would be exploiting a bug, even if you didnt want it, then get banned. Hell... For a month you couldnt fucking tank. Imagine if tanks in wow stopped working for a month. Imagine that. At this point I dont care who I'm blaming, maybe zenimax, maybe bethesda, hell, maybe even microsoft, I really dont care who is fucking up THIS BAD, but it needs to change, the game is losing people left and right and yeah, new people will come in.. But good luck learning end game without raid leads.. Ive been a raid lead for months, helping new people learn the ropes, then everything got nerfed and my work was even harder, I had good people dying because the devs ""forgot"" that healers are important too and that there were heal checks in the game.. Which mathematically couldnt be passed without trial gear.. And you needed to pass that check to get your trial gear.. See the problem? The devs don't play the game at all and act like the end game community is just trash.. The truth is there is some trashy people but the rest of the end game community has been giving this game their all for many years and we are the sole reason why new players can get into trials, because we do them for them, because devs cant be fucking arsed to even make a god damn tutorial of the game for the new players that covers more than the movement and some common keys. They are milking the hell out of the game and its players with 4 different ways of making money, again, game, dlc, subscription and microtransactions (and the game is now also p2w, either beicause of artifacts that you need to buy an overpriced dlc or becuase you can just buy gold with your crowns) For bethesda: Im tired, you destroyed a game I loved and you know what? Good for me, cause I cant keep wasting my time on this, fuck your addictive mechanics, your continuous disrespect for the player base, you carrot on the stick behaviour.. You should be ashamed that you had so much potential and you just didnt have the balls to go against the higher ups that tell you do destroy the game, this new age of short term return on investment is ruining games, im out to play dwarf fortress, see ya.",0.869186341762542725

Having smaller bank for non-subscriber is not great, but what kills the fun is the hundreds of crafting ingredients that are useful to keep around... But if you don't pay monthly for the craft bag, you are in hell. Every time you run out for a quest, you spend a boring amount of time of thinking what you need to throw out of your inventory instead of playing the game. I can deal with paying for the game, paying for the chapters, paying for the DLC, paying (or not) for the gold edition : but needing an auto-renewing monthly payments for not having an on purpose frustrating game is not a game design practice I can stand by ! Make crafting bag free and i will change this comment. -------------------- Edit : Wow, this review blew up. IMPORTANT UPDATE : a few comments called me or every person sharing the same opinion ""pathetic m*ron"", ""whiny idi*t"", ""lazy"", ""sp*iled brat""... Let me address that real quick : the rumors about unlocking an achievement in the game for flaming me with insults are false. *Flaming other players does not unlock an achievement*. So quit doing that ok ? More seriously, it's totally ok to disagree with my comment and many replies expressed different opinions about that in a respectful way. Thank you ! Please, follow that example when you talk to others (internet or IRL), you will most of the time get a more positive outcome. You could get away with being some amount of disrespectful 99% of the time, but then at one point in your life, it will really matter. You won't know it beforehand but based on how respectful you are, this person will think of you completely differently, this will change your life. At some point in time you will get fired or promoted, you will get appreciated by your peers or cast out, you will get loved or discarded like a level 1 pewter dust molecule. It all trace back to the few moments you gained respect by giving respect, without even noticing it. At one point in your life, maybe you will remember this comment, maybe this will help someone, and ultimately it's a lot more important than crafting bags. I realize i could have worded the original review better and it would have led to a more positive outcome, i'm sure :) This text is not important : Back to crafting bags... Please, be aware that I'm describing my own experience. I understand people really liking the game and getting in the habit to work around the issue by giving up loots, getting an amount of extra slots with easy to get in game credits that allow you to only discard 50% of the materials you collect instead of 70%, creating 9 accounts as a mule, using 3rd party tools, or ""if you dont craft you dont need a crafting bag"" (Roll Safe meme comes to my mind with this last one). It will help some players who can enjoy the game despite this limitations. However, I stand by my comment. It's not an idiotic thing to request good game design. I have played many games with limited inventory, paid a fair price for some space in them (never regretted supporting the game developers) and/or worked around the limits. But ESO+ crafting bag is not just about quantity of stuff you store, it means no time wasting with inventory management. I think i really addressed that particular problem in my original review (that you can read unedited above). I could have been more careful about how it only reflects my own experience, but i thought it was expected that any review express the opinion of it's reviewer. Everyone should play a game because it's fun. For me, the extra amount of time spent doing inventory management is unfun, even with workarounds properly used. You get to try crafting bags during some ESO+ free weeks, so I know the difference. *Renting* a good UX or working around a bad one, neither of those choices looks appealing to me. I compared this experience with the one i get in other games, decided to stop playing ESO, and left this explanation here.",0.86871039867401123

English,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Awaken as an unstoppable warrior and battle alongside your friends in this story-driven free-to-play online action game,Digital Extremes,Warframe,Digital Extremes,"INTRODUCTION Almost 5840 hours in this game (~3200 purely in missions). I've only had one break so far. It was in 2017 and it lasted 1 month. I took that break cuz I had other games I wanted to play more. But now... I don't, I have nothing to play and nothing to do. Yet I can't get myself to play this game I loved with all my heart. I've been there for most of this game's history and I am telling you... Warframe was never in such a bad state. THE MAIN PROBLEM So, what exactly has happened? It's pretty simple (and that's why it's even more sad that the DEVs can't do anything about it). DE's (Digital Extremes) approach to this game has changed a lot. The same DEVs that used to be praised as the ""best developers ever that listen to the community's feedback and are like a family"" stopped caring about the feedback almost completely. They only listen to new players feedback, they listen to the players that can't see the game's issues. They listen to the players that will be constantly patting DE on their head saying how everything is awesome and this is the best game ever. Because of this, the content DE started making is extremely mediocre. It's boring, repetitive, non-challanging and usually lasts about a week. DE also tends to release content, do few patches for it and then completely abandon it. Which is the better case. In the worse case, they can even kill part of their own game with some new content. ENDGAME IS A MEME This has always been a thing in Warframe... - ""So, what's the endgame of this game?"". - ""Well, there is non atm., but the next update looks promising!"" Guess what... No update brought the endgame people wanted. The game is extremely easy and requires absolutely no challange. The weapons and Warframes you have are extremely powerful and you oneshot pretty much everything. There might be some harder content in this game, but it doesn't matter. Because there are no rewards in this content that would any MR5+ player appreciate. COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT Warframe's support got extremely bad. People are getting auto-banned for doing things like staying in a mission for 2+ hours. Not even kidding with this one. Staying in a mission for this long used to be absolutely normal btw. And guess what.. People are having troubles with getting unbanned. The community management team got extremely sensitive and they can ban you for literally anything that's not 110% politically correct. Warframe has a partner program. It used to have many cool people trying to help their favorite game... DE canceled this program not so long ago and when re-creating it, they basically refused every content creator that makes amazing content, but isn't always super positive about everything DE does. They want no feedback basically. I tried to apply to the old program in 2018, because I also used to make WF content. Back in 2018, I didn't have enough subscribers to join, but I tried it anyways.. Even tho I didn't meet the requirements, I got an answer. Actually, I was messaging via email with a really nice guy from the support team. He told me to make sure I'll apply again once I meet the requirements. It's 2020 and I applied again. I meet all the requirements now, but... I got no answer.. I sent another apply.. It's been few months now, still no answer. Guess they don't care about a smaller content creators anymore. BUT IT'S FREE, DON'T JUDGE IT! This is honestly the biggest bs I've ever heard. Warframe earns an extreme amount of money from the microtransactions. Their budget is huge, yet they still don't have own servers except for relays (the game is still peer to peer). I don't know what they are doing with those money, but they are definitely not investing into the game's future as they could. OUTRO And that's pretty much it... I tried to put it as simple as possible. Funny, right? I still hope DE will realize they are slowly killing their game and will do something about it. But right now, I am really sad about Warframe's state. Peace to all the Tennos that managed to read it to these final words.",0.885976672172546387
English,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Awaken as an unstoppable warrior and battle alongside your friends in this story-driven free-to-play online action game,Digital Extremes,Warframe,Digital Extremes,"I know, I know. Another negative Warframe review from a salty player with lots of hours in the game. How original. Look, you've probably heard plenty of crap about this game from other negative reviews, but this is just my two cents: For the amount of time you put into this game to earn things, you could achieve so much more in other games. For the amount of money you put into this game, you could gain so much more from other free-to-play titles. But what is it recently that made me quit? THE GRIND Well, a fair few months ago, when Vauban Prime came out, I took a ~8 month break from the game, because of how unbelievably grindy it got. DE (the developers) increased the resource cost of things astronomically - like how some resources can only be obtained during rare, limited-time missions (nitain extract) or rare resources that remove themselves from your inventory after just 24 hours (Argon Crystals). CONTENT IMPLEMENTATION But it's okay, because DE releases fresh new content sometimes, right? Well, every time DE implements something, it's terribly implemented. Atrociously so. But sometimes DE comes back and revisits this content, sticks ""2.0"" at the end of the name, and treat it like a whole new thing. They might fix some issues, but introduce a slew of new problems. An example of this is the ""focus"" system. Basically, without spoilers, you get certain types of XP for certain types of skill trees by using weapons or gear with a certain attatchment on them. When this was introduced, gaining ""focus"" points was ridiculously slow. After a while, DE responded to community complaints by advertising that they'd introduce a consumable that would appear on the map after certain time intervals, and give all players a 6x multiplier on their focus gains. Awesome, right? What they really did was nerf how much Focus you get by making it an absolutely tiny fraction of what people were initially complaining about - then the 6x multiplier would only make up for the nerf. This is in the same update, mind you. And DE didn't communicate this at all. And now they've moved on again, forgetting about the focus system, just like every other previously implemented system in the game. WEAPON & GEAR BALANCE Update 18.13 introduced nerfs to warframes (exoskeletons that are essentially interchangable classes) that didn't deserve a nerf. Many warframes that previously filled niche purposes were suddenly completely useless or outdone by other warframes. Certain builds people had on their warframes were now irrelevant. It was a shit show. And DE left it like that. But for the longest time, people had been asking DE to balance all weapons in the game. Because there are hundreds of them - and it's a mess. Some can instantly wipe out all high level enemies in the vicinity, others require constant firing for minutes on end just to take down the same enemy. It is the worst I've ever seen in any game. But that's okay, because DE created a fix that came with update 19, otherwise known as The War Within. This fix would be known as... RIVEN MODS Riven mods. Basically, these are meant to be how DE rebalances the weapons of Warframe. And it is just the worst thing I've ever seen be added to the game. Basically, Riven mods are mods for your gear that make them better. And they can make them way better. The problem? This didn't just apply to the terrible weapons that needed rebalancing - this applied to all weapons. And this is meant to be the fix that rebalanced weapons. I cannot fathom the stupidity behind this decision. It's laziness and stupidity. Want to rebalance all weapons in the game, just like the players asked for? Sweet! Players will now have to grind against a time-locked grind on sortie (daily) missions for a small chance at obtaining a Riven mod, which then requires player to complete another arbitrary task just to ""unveil"" the Riven mod and make it usable, and then the player is left in the hands of RNG on what weapon the Riven mod worked with. That's right, Riven mods are locked to only working with ONE weapon. Just one. Out of hundreds. It could be something you don't even own. It could be for a useless weapon, and still not make it good enough to compete with the high-tier weapons, or just be further nerfs to what are already the best weapons in the game. So what do these Riven mods do? That is also left to RNG. These mods can do anything from giving a flat-out boost to damage, coming with useless buffs (adding additional % slash damage on a weapon that only 1% of it's damage as slash) or even nerfs, such as decreased damage and increased recoil. Didn't like the way your Riven mod came out? You can reroll the traits it has with a whole new resource that requires a constant, conscious effort to grind, all while the cost for re-rolling your Rivens increases with every re-roll. However, DE did make two fixes: they capped the resource increase for re-rolling Rivens to 3500 kuva, and made it so lesser-used weapons gain stronger buffs from Riven mods. But only after community outcry. Because the devs are so lazy, oblivious and moronic that it took the players say ""umm, buffing ALL WEAPONS with rare mods doesn't fix the weapon balance issues"" for them to change anything. And when they did ""fix"" it, it barely made a difference. THE LAST STRAW The Glast Gambit came out a few days before I wrote this review. With it, a new weapon was introduced - the Hema, and a new warframe - Nidus. Now, what's great about some warframes is that you can get their parts in quests. Sure, these quests were super grindy, but it was better than the alternative - many warframes in the game can only be obtained by having boss enemies drop CERTAIN PARTS of CERTAIN WARFRAMES which requires credits, resources and TWELVE HOURS EACH TO BUIILD and THEN you may construct the warframe with the final stage of crafting - actually constructing the warframe. Which takes SEVENTY-TWO HOURS. In quests, as you complete each grindy objective, you're rewarded with a part, which you craft - for credits, resources, and and a twelve hour wait. But it's better than having the part drop from a boss - where there is only an obscure chance that you get the part you want. This was the case with the warframe known as Chroma. DE decided Chroma was clearly too easy to get, after a while, and decided to split up the pieces and making rewards for clearing different systems, sets of levels, and side objectives. Yep. Now, the Glast Gambit rewards you with one piece of the Nidus warframe - the blueprint. Not other part. The other parts can only be obtained from a LOW DROP RATE from only EVERY FOURTH ROUND from a new, grindy, repetitive game mode. That's right. You have a low chance every foruth round after much repitition on just one level - the only level to contain this new game mode - and play it over and over and over and over again until you get the warframe parts. Which then require twelve hours, some credits and some resources to complete. And then you may build the warframe - requiring a 72 hour wait. Well, that's shit. So what about the new weapon, the Hema? It requires mutagen samples. A lot. Mutagen samples are a very uncommon resource that can only be found in certain areas of the game, and requires more mutagen samples to research than all other weapons requiring mutagen samples to research combined. Now, you see, weapon research gets a bit cheaper when your clan has less players. So those clans dedicated to helping out new players? Fuck them. DE just shat on them. And you can only be in one clan at a time. So people are being mass-kicked from clans, and it's anarchy. And DE doesn't care. They want people spending real money to buy gear from them, and will encourage players to stab each other in the back to make a buck. What scum. I'm done. I'm sad it came to this.

English,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Awaken as an unstoppable warrior and battle alongside your friends in this story-driven free-to-play online action game,Digital Extremes,Warframe,Digital Extremes,"I have played this game since I was in High School, I have nearly 2700 hours, and I'm MR 24. I have collected most of the weapons/frames, played every major update since 2015, and have meta-gamed so hard my friends were at times scared at how good I was at speeding through missions. Warframe has been one of the games I'd never leave uninstall for long. And I am telling you now, after 6 years of playing: Warframe is no longer worth your time or your money. Other reviews would list out the Good parts of the game first before going into their objections. I'm not going to do that because all the game's virtues have been sung so hard that the fat lady's vocal chords are starting to break. The TL;DR Version: This, now Tencent owned, game has replaced content with grind - one that gives diminishing returns - and the developers are no longer making meaningful content. I'll give 3 big reasons why I've chosen after so long to finally put the game down for good: 1) The game becomes less fun the more you play. When you first start the game, everything is new, novel, interesting. Your first 10 Mastery Ranks are gonna be filled with exciting, lore filled quests, new weapons, new frames. Mechanics are introduced through interesting quests, you'll start working builds to get the most out of it. It's fun, challenging, slightly confusing, but fun. But once you start going through ranks 11 onward, then the grind really kicks into motion. Things will cost exponentially more, first as an optional upgrade to your existing weapons, and eventually becoming the de-facto fee for entry (Railjack, I'm looking at you with your 6 million credit requirement). Meaning you gotta start meta-gaming, grinding as specific planets, spending hours on the same tileset for moderate rewards. Hit the Index, spend a couple hours farming credits that will be gone before you know it. Need Endo? well you better find Ayatan Sculptures, and you're gonna need a fair few if you want to max out your best mods. Spend hours upon hours in the same survival mission just for a chance at one retardedly rare mod. Better buy those boosters with platinum if you want the grind to be shaved a bit off. And throughout all of that, the amount of stuff you'll need will increase, even if you cut as many corners as possible. The time it will take to get the final goal will increase, the drop rates for certain items will be next to impossible, and you will, eventually, just not have enough time in your day to do it all. Unless you are a professional No-Lifer and dedicate the majority of your day to grinding, and even if you are a No-lifer this will still apply, you'll find that what once took hours will now take days, and what took days will now take a whole lot longer - Weeks, months, possibly years. There's just no amount of fun weapons/Weapon builds that will ever make that slower as you make the eventual realization that you are no longer grinding for the new content; the grind *is* the new content. 2) The Developers are no longer making Meaningful updates What do I mean by this? In this case, Meaningful is being used to describe updates that introduce something that changes how we play the game to a major degree, either from the new mechanics or aspects introduced, or by making changes to existing aspects to the game that shake up the meta. The mark for where Digital Extremes had made their last Meaningful update is a bit debatable. The more hardcore players would say that the Second Dream was the last meaningful update, where others would claim that The Old Blood was that point of no return. Me personally, I'd give that ""honor"" to Railjack, as it introduced genuinely new mechanics into the game, and despite it's roughness, it does have that going for it. There have been many major updates since then, but none have really done anything new or different. Most updates now fall into that ""grind for hours upon hours and get a small reward every week or so"" category. Each consecutive update only increasing the grind that needs to be done to get the same rewards. You could always play older content, but that will get very old very quick. Simply put: The Devs no longer need to make new content because they know that no matter what they do, there's enough people who will eat whatever slop is put in front of them and then ask for more. 3) It's now owned by Tencent The previous two problems are general, and many other players who have quit the game will tell you something similar. This... this is a personal moral objection I have to why I stopped playing. Digital Extremes was recently bought by Tencent, the company that infamously owns half of the Epic Game Store. Tencent is located in China, and is therefore owned, either in part or in its entirety, by the Communist Party of China, as the country's laws dictate. The Chinese Communist Party are the same sons of whores that are currently committing mass genocide of ethnic minorities for the crime of not being the Han Chinese ""Master Race"" and are systematically oppressing their own people through whatever means necessary. This means that for every dollar, Euro, Pound, whatever you spend on this game, Tencent gets a cut of that profit, and that means China gets a cut of that profit, and they will use that cut to perpetuate their evil practices. And that's before we get into the intentional security issues Tencent owned products have. Even if you don't care at all about the bad game practices, then I would suggest not supporting a game that, through 2 degrees of separation, supports actual Fascists, is probably a good idea. These are just 3 reasons why I stopped playing the game. Going online, you'll find a lot more reasons that people had that made them finally say ""That's it, I'm done"" to this game. If after all of this, you still feel like playing the game, I won't stop you. Enjoy yourself while you are able to do so. As for me? I'm off to play other games that I enjoy. I'll always remember the good times I had with this game, and maybe one day I'll come back and play it when it does something new - maybe then my opinion will improve a little bit. But for now, this game will no longer be seeing any of my time, or money, spent on it. Have a great day.",0.850333988666534424

I always liked the power fantasy, art and music of this game. And especially loved the freedom of choice and direction warframe was headed since after the second dream cinematic quest. The Devs had many brilliant ideas, that unfortunately were implemented half baked and buggy. They wanted to make warframe bigger and bigger with each update.. developing open world like landscapes with fishing, mining, hunting and skateboarding. Further there were arcade games, guitar hero, spaceship combat and mechs. All of those things were completely new content islands with little impact to the core gameplay. Every update brought new ressources that you had to farm again .. the solution to the old resource bloat was, that they created a system for players to fix bad warframes/abilities themselves by sacrificing huge amounts of those resources. With every new step the devs took, the freedom of choice was reduced(in Railjack the most IMO) and every bit of content was made more grindy (mainly through RNG). Players then went and picked the most efficient methods to farm the same missions over and over. But DE likes statistics .. so they looked at the graphs and instead of fixing the problematic parts of the game, they nerfed those outliers to the ground .. sometimes even so much, that they made other parts of the game unplayable ... The Devs say they look at feedback .. but most times they only use feedback that goes in the direction the devs wanted to go anyway .. With crossplay next, they aimed for the mobile gaming plattform too and had to change the game on all other platforms to fix the mobile controls .. which resulted in clunky movements for everyone .. Well..let's hope crossplay saves the dead servers in some regions, for those that still want to play this game.... The next big update of warframe seems to be a rogue-like game mode .. probably another content island with layers of RNG ontop of each other.. Now that it has come to this state I'm done with this game and feel sad about all the years I supported the devs,... Thanks for reading. Take care.",0.846625626087188721

I've stuck with Warframe for far longer than any player should. I've been around since the Founder era. I've experienced both the highs and the lows. I've shaken hands with the devs. No, this review is not a gut reaction to the AOE nerf that seems to be in the spotlight. But rather, exists because of the progressive condition infecting Warframe that I personally refer to as ""Toxic MMOsis."" Symptoms include pus-like RNG discharge, feverish FOMO, and an unwitting addiction to boring, monotonous chores. -- The Heart of Warframe -- To sum it up, Warframe's core is an exciting F2P robot ninja shooter. But, these days, there's a lot of not-Warframe in Warframe. From hunting, to fishing, to mining, to... whatever Lunaro was supposed to be - I'd say DE was trying to be adventurous but in reality, they're simply relegating to tried-and-true MMO gameplay loops to pad out with a dull, lifeless grind. Even so, I stand by the premise that I don't mind grind as long as the grind involves exciting gameplay and WF's movement and shooting mechanics are nearly unparalleled. But when a grind takes me away from the core content I love, that's when I call foul. Warframe's core is sound but you now have to work to get to it. And who plays games to work? ..but that's enough about that. -- What the Heck is Toxic MMOsis, Anyways? -- I've defined Toxic MMOsis as the sacrifice of gameplay and player experience to cater to the company's greed by artificially boosting sales & play time. Toxic MMOsis is a disease not exclusively present in MMOs, but most commonly found festering there. Toxic MMOsis often comes in the form of rampant RNG, randomized, cycle-able equipment, loot boxes and other risk/reward upgrade systems that are borderline gambling. These aren't so much gameplay loops that people want as much as gameplay loops players learn to need. These strategies exploit human behavior, especially in the big spenders game companies lovingly refer to as ""whales."" Some of those behaviors include, decision paralysis, sunk cost fallacy, FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), and the same endorphin release experienced when winning big at a slot machine. Early Warframe opposed and abhorred Toxic MMOsis. It was, first and foremost, a passion project to be experienced. It relied on its mod system to provide build flexibility in spades. Once you earned a thing, whether it be a frame, mod, or weapon, it is yours. Paint it pink, have it spew fire and ice, make it unload 500 little BBs in 5 seconds; whatever man, you do you! DE even regularly provided exciting new content, whether it be a progression in the story, a revamped system to toy with, or new weapons & frames to engage with. Warframe was, in my eyes, revolutionary in the MMO world. Most MMOs up to that point implemented respecs, character/tree resets, RNG upgrade systems where you could lose all your progress in a weapon, and frustrating, time-gated grinds. Each of these systems could be (and often are) integrated into a devious monetization scheme to entice those ""whales"" to turn their pockets inside out to compensate for the time sink. Not early Warframe. That was beyond them. -- Honest Feature Trailers -- Enough preamble - here's a quick (non-comprehensive) timeline of DE's roadtrip to hell. I've even formulated my artist's rendition of DE's thought process akin to one of those brutally honest game/movie trailers. Keep in mind, most of these new systems took the form of a new content lake, distinct from everything else, further muddling the experience for old and new players alike. * Events - occasional events that offered timed exclusive content FOMO - Don't play those other games releasing this weekend! Come back to play Warframe! We have weapons only available here this week... But don't worry - if you miss out, we'll offer them again! We just won't tell you when. Maybe next week. Maybe next year! But most likely when that shiny, new game you've been eyeing releases. * Focus System - introduced grindy skill trees that could not be respecced Sunk cost/Decision Paralysis - Ooooo, choose your school wisely because if you don't like your build, you'll have to spend tons more time to fix it! But hey, you can always buy these handy lenses to hasten your journey to the top with real money! Don't worry - we're not exploiting you since you can't just buy focus outright! That'd be awful. Gosh, who would do such a thing? * Sorties - introduced a weekly challenge FOMO - We've noticed you don't play Warframe every week! Did you forget we own a percentage of your life and a chunk of your soul? Let's remind you with these glorious new Rivens to amplify that one weapon you probably don't even use! Keep getting those useless Endo statues? Better try next week! And the next week! And the next week... * Riven System - introduced an RNG-based mod cycling mechanic Gambling - Finally got that Riven for the weapon you like but don't like the 500% aim zoom it so generously provides your Lato? Spend Kuva to cycle it to your heart's content! We dare you to TRY and roll the same stats you saw on our contracted Youtube partner's video you saw yesterday! But hey, it's totally not gambling because you can't buy Kuva! All it asks from you is your hard earned time & resources. Who needs a social life, right? * Nightwave System - the almighty pinnacle of time gating: a battle pass FOMO - What? You say you need a break from Warframe? Nah, just come and stay with us. We'll give you free stuff for engaging with neglected old systems so we can show our share holders that people LOVE fishing and it totally wasn't a waste of company time! We'll even introduce some extremely rare upgrades towards the end of the pass... But it's free, so, fine!... right? * Archon System - time-gating + RNG = disappointment FOMO - Hmm... we have a power creep problem. But whales love being the BEST! Oh well! Let's introduce more power creep, gate it behind weekly events, and lock the best shards behind RNG! Whales will go NUTS! Didn't get that Tauforged shard you wanted? Of course you didn't! Give it a few weeks! You'll DEFINITELY get it next time! ""So what?"" You might be asking. ""Lots of game companies use these tactics!"" True, but they shouldn't be rewarded for it. Players are slowly beginning to understand how games manipulate them and, to no one's surprise, they don't appreciate it. Games from AAA studios have become less about fun and more about greed. Warframe showed us before that it can support itself with crispy content, and fair gameplay mechanics. They were able to demonstrate this throughout its early lifespan and beat the odds, generating a massive fanbase despite little in the way of corporate funding. But now, it's clear they've lost sight of their passion. They've steadily reset the bar with each new content drop and convinced people they're still the good guys even though they're just hiding in the shadow cast by sinister ringleaders in the corporate world. -- TLDR; -- * Warframe is a great 3rd person shooter held back by its systems * Warframe does not respect player time * Warframe is riddled with RNG and FOMO mechanics * Warframe is swarming with boring content that masks a truly fun gameplay core * Warframe's disparate content lakes are daunting for new players and don't reward returning ones And most importantly: * Warframe's developers at DE lost sight of their original passion; Warframe is no longer Warframe If you are playing this game and happen to read this, I encourage you to uninstall and support up-and-coming developers who still have that fire ignited in them.

While the game is still a technical marvel, weighting barely 30GB and packed with free content, I decided to uninstall it today after months of not playing. There used to be a vision, a drive behind warframe. This vision changed over time, of course, but in my opinion for the worse. In the early days, Warframe felt dark and difficult. I remember my first time encountering infested and running for my life as a fresh newbie. But as time progressed, people got stronger, the balance flaws became easier to spot, and so warframe evolved into almost a hack'n'slash in 3rd person view. And I loved it! It's fun to grind enemies to get better gear, loot, and endurance runs became feasible. But over the past 2 years, the game has been slowly dying. I'm not gonna elaborate on the story (New War), DE basically took a 2 year hiatus. They forced Necramech gameplay on us, and now operator shenanigans. Nullifiers were bad, but new eximus are worse. Control-based warframes are useless in endgame settings. Single Target weapons and frames are even more useless than before. Focus rework was supposed to give us more options, but it failed. Nuke Meta using tank warframes is not cool, not fun, but has become the only viable way to play the game. At this point it feels like developers are actively trying to fight what is in essence Warframe's true nature : a cull the weak third person hack'n'slash. New content is poorly refined, poorly balanced. Anything fun or remotely advantaging players always gets nerfed asap. What's even more frustrating is there is potential in their updates, but it always fall short, unbalanced and mediocre. I'd like to say ""they need to seriously think about where they want to go and what they must do to enable it"", but I'm afraid the way they want to go is not what I personally want for the game. This gap is growing ever larger and it's time for me to abandon ship.",0.826206624507904053
English,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Awaken as an unstoppable warrior and battle alongside your friends in this story-driven free-to-play online action game,Digital Extremes,Warframe,Digital Extremes,"Update 31.5, Angels of the Zariman, is the final straw for me. It makes me sad, because I did truly love Warframe. Look at my hours logged. I bought a Founder's pack way back in the day, one of the expensive ones, too. I've put probably a grand or so into this game. Nearly every hour spent in it, I loved. But quite frankly, U31.5 is just kind of representative of a downhill slope the game has been on for the last four years. 2018 was the last year that Warframe updates were good. In late 2018, DE added the second open world. Placed on Venus and centered around a hub social zone called Fortuna, this new open world zone would be the last update that Warframe received without a curling of the monkey's paw - though even Fortuna was not a completely safe release. Alongside the new zone, a new class of ""modular"" secondary weapons was also added that introduced significant power creep in a way the game had, until that point, largely avoided. But at the time, it seemed harmless. Each subsequent update saw an aggressive curling of the monkey's paw. The Lich update was supposed to add dynamic boss enemies a la Shadow of Mordor's nemesis system. Instead it added boss monsters that must be manually spawned by players, and which, for the first three months post-release, had phases in their fight with mandatory player deaths. Yes, you read that correctly - Digital Extremes added a boss fight phase that requires the player to die. The Railjack update was supposed to add complex ship-crewing mechanics for four players, with one at the helm, two on the guns, and one on engineering. This update was also supposed to include an in-depth system for power management within the ship, a la Elite Dangerous. Instead, it added an even clunkier grinding zone that required randos to figure out how to patch holes in the ship lest it explode. The power management system was never added at all. Later updates would add NPCs that can patch the ship's hull, completely eliminating the need for multiple players. The Scarlet Spear event was supposed to add a squad-link functionality that would allow players to send each other benefits across multiple squads - a sort of multi-server buff synchronicity. Instead, it quickly became obvious that the system was obfuscating and fabricating this synchronicity - generating buffs from nothing, and doing nothing with buffs generated by players. The Heart of Deimos update was supposed to add a new open world centered around the game's zombie faction, with a complex ecosystem and new mission sets involving pilotable mechs a la Titanfall. Instead, it added an even smaller open world than the previous two, with more frustrating ecological mechanics, and tiny mechs that are (a) a giant grind to obtain, and (b) literally only useful in content that is gated off until you obtain one. Do you see the pattern here? Digital Extremes comes up with an idea, they market and sell that idea, then they present ""content"" that is at best a baleful shadow of what was promised. Angels of the Zariman takes this issue to its logical conclusion. Core to Warframe's gameplay is a duality between the Warframe equipped, and the Operator character used to control it. The player is encouraged to regularly swap between them in-combat; this system is meant to be quick, fluid, and flashy. Angels of the Zariman was supposed to make this system more fluid, give the Operator character more abilities and use-cases, and generally allow quicker and more convenient swapping between the two. Instead, it completely gutted the Operator's skillset, added a (frankly, bizarre) cooldown on swapping between Operator and Warframe, deleted significant amounts of player progress with zero rebate, and added *nothing.* Angels of the Zariman is the culmination of Digital Extremes' boneheaded decision-making over the years. At this point all I can assume is that it is intentional sabotage. The people in charge of the title must, I can only assume, have grown bored of working on the game and are now trying to drive enough people out that they can shut it down without breaching their contract with Tencent. Oh yeah, did I mention Tencent bought DE? Because they very much did - right around 2018, actually. But don't think too hard about that, friend. That'd be Sinophobic.

English,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Awaken as an unstoppable warrior and battle alongside your friends in this story-driven free-to-play online action game,Digital Extremes,Warframe,Digital Extremes,"This is a bittersweet review for me. I've been heavily invested in this game three separate times with years-long hiatus between each stint. I've accumulated 1460.9 hours, the most of any game in my library and to be clear, I don't regret any of that time spent. Just a few weeks ago, I abruptly quit playing for the third time and this time I'm fairly certain I'm never coming back. Over the past few weeks I've been racking my brain, trying to understand how a game I love so much can make me feel so bad. I believe I've nailed down a few key points. THEORY CRAFTING The one thing I love most about this game spits straight back in my eye. Warframe has the most intricate theory crafting system I've ever seen. The problem is no one cares, nor does the game require them to care, nor do I think it would be possible to require them to care. By design, Warframe is hyper-prone to having ALL creativity mathematically optimized out. With every shot you take, brightly colored damage numbers and will pour out of your enemies. While the big colorful damage numbers are an effective addiction algorithm for most players, myself included, they're also an invitation for math nerds to cull every piece of equipment that isn't the best from common usage in the game. A player might spend countless hours reading every mod card, delving into different stats, and pondering synergies. They might enjoy building, testing, and optimizing something uniquely suited to a certain task and take pride in the engineering that went into building that piece of equipment. They might even strike gold every once in a while, and through deep understanding of the modding system and a little bit of help from RNG, manage to build a truly exceptional assault rifle, but there's a problem. The meta is AoE right now, not assault rifle. Effort and creativity are worthless in Warframe. You'll load into a mission with three other Tenno and your rifle which is fully capable of murdering massive hordes of the enemy, but you'll never touch a single one. Those three other Tenno are carrying explosive arrows or launchers and at the start of the mission they took off like a pack of greyhounds, greedily racing to get that rabbit before you. You might catch on to the competitive nature of an extermination mission and make sure that you also move with purpose, but there's another problem. With your single-target weapon, you'll actually have to aim at enemies and even if you've prioritized movement speed, you will never out run those explosive arrows. The lazily-aimed arrows will whiz past you, land on the ground in the middle of a horde, and everything within a 20m radius will be dead before you ever had a chance to use your creation. Not the best feeling when you're playing a horde shooter and there are no hordes to kill. Some may disagree, but I don't believe there is single mission type in this game that requires communication, teamwork, or specialization of loadout/role in any significant way. What that breeds is an insidious, copy/paste meta that enables players to kill the most enemies in the shortest amount of time, all for the reward of seeing that they did 99% of the damage on the stat page at the end of any given mission. This leads into my next point. WARFRAME FAILS AS AN MMO Another aspect of Warframe that I really love is fashion. You'll hear people say that fashion frame is the true endgame and I don't disagree. The game offers a dizzying number of color palates, stylish accessories, and ornamentation, all of which can be mixed and matched to the heart's content. The type of player who woke up in Skyrim and proceeded to agonize over their Dragonborn's facial features for hours before ever starting the game will be right at home in Warframe. You'll spend hours getting every emissive color combination just right, trying on accessory after accessory, weapon after weapon, applying skins, and even adjusting holster positions to look just right. You might even purchase loadout slots specifically for those frames you styled or pick up some miniature ""warframe articula"" (ball joint dolls) of your favorite frames that you can place around your ship. All of this really tickles a creative center in my brain that drives me to produce beautiful things to share with the world. The issue is that no one in this world is encouraged to look beyond their nose. Despite having 20mil registered users and common areas in the game that are bustling with activity 24/7, Warframe still manages to isolate me from my fellow Tenno. There are a couple different reasons for this. For one, the game has limited options for relaxed social interaction with random players. Yes, there's text chat, but it's clunky. Sometimes in an easier mission, you might see the occasional casual banter, but for most part when you're in mission, everyone is focused on playing the game, not interacting. You might think the common spaces I mentioned, where you'll find hundreds of roaming Tenno would be a better place for that sort of interaction, but you'd be wrong. If I like a Tenno's aesthetic and I walk up to them in Cetus, there is no slick way of giving them a compliment or striking up a conversation. There's no prox chat, so I'll never have the strange and unique experience of another player hearing me through a wall, striking up a muffled conversation and offering me some chicken because I was starving like I had in DayZ the other day. Perhaps most importantly, there are objectives to pursue in every single space within the game. There is no dedicated social space. Clans in this game are not about people you enjoy. They're about trading and collecting clan research to build new weapons, warframes, etc. The aforementioned common spaces in the game are merely jumping off points for the game's ""open world"" areas as well as a place to engage in mini-quests by engaging with the town NPCs. The point I'm trying to make is everyone you come across in one of these places has somewhere better to be. They didn't come to the common space to pay attention to anything other than the addictive objectives the game laid out for them. Standing in the middle of one of these spaces feels like walking the streets of NYC on a weekday. No one is relaxed and no one cares you exist. Warframe may technically be massively multiplayer, but it leaves me feeling massively alone, on my ship, surrounded by my stylish dollies. WARFRAME IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY EASY GAME You can try to do all your own theory crafting and tune out noise about the current meta, but at some point even the most unplugged player will realize how mind-numbingly easy Warframe is. The game cleverly disguises this with excellent mechanics, time-locked progression, and extremely low drop chances for certain items. This makes the game seem more difficult than it is, and indeed there is skill involved in mastering the mechanics, but at core, all one NEEDS to do is click on (or for AoE, click near) hordes of squishy enemies and occasionally press the 1,2,3, and 4 keys. Yes, enemy HP scales, but with a well-built weapon, enemies at all levels die on command for as many hours as you want to sit there clicking on them. Enemy damage also scales, but current meta survivability techniques make it easy for even newer players to become perma-invincible vs level cap enemies. At some point over the years, DE actually did make the game's enemies substantially weaker while simultaneously introducing items and systems that have pushed power creep to insane levels. Why DE would want to make an already easy game even easier boggles my mind. Add on top of all of this that 99% of the player base are using the most mathematically optimized weapons, frames, and builds, mindlessly copied and pasted from their preferred Youtuber and you have a recipe for sheer boredom that no amount of good gameplay mechanics can redeem. The game isn't all bad, but its endless, addictive gameplay loops ultimately have little reward.",0.815309047698974609
English,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Awaken as an unstoppable warrior and battle alongside your friends in this story-driven free-to-play online action game,Digital Extremes,Warframe,Digital Extremes,"On the cusp of having 1,300 hours into this game that I have played since 2014, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone looking for long-term playing. I just recently uninstalled and quit playing. Again. For the third time. This game is an absolute grind-fest. It was fun the first few hundred hours or so but at a certain point, it stopped being fun and started to become incredibly tedious. Mats and blueprints, mats and blueprints, don't forget the random alerts (dead) and definitely do your dailies. Every game became a mad dash as you and your teammates rush to finish the objective, find the few worthy material drops, and run frantically to the exit (RIP Ember's WoF). All of my favorite gear and weapons have been buffed and nerfed to hell over the years, yet I can manage to dole out tens of thousands of damage per second because of multiple formas and crazy riven mod builds. I just think it's another inconsistent and roundabout way to force players to grind even more for what they want to achieve. Most of the updates now a days add these crazy hurdles in the form of materials needed. At first it was the Dojo. Man, the time I spent gathering mats and building trivial stupid things like drums and plants. And now archwings, K drives, warframes and weapons; crafting these things all required the same thing: Every single hour of your life that you can afford to give, maybe even more. If I could buy my time back I gladly would, but I can't. I can only buy Plat. There are a multitude of issues I have with this game, but every time I think about Warframe I get so mad at myself for wasting so much time with it, I can't clearly think about the problems that I truly have with it. It runs deeper than me not liking the grind; it's very problematic and the main fanbase seems to be completely okay with that, but I just think that the game has run it's course. The past few updates have admittedly enticed me into coming back to play them, but shortly, the initial optimism is quickly snubbed as I begin to get that familiar feeling: I've been here before, I've done this grind before. It's the same grind for a different reason, just some new ""rare"" materials for a shiny new item. And as always, the end result is anticlimactic. Cool archwing collection you got there, its a shame archwing missions kinda suck. Oh hey cool, a giant space frigate. Oh wait I have to build it all by myself? What's the point of building this in the Dojo? I... just honestly don't know what else to say. I'm constantly at a loss for words whenever I try describe how I feel about this game. I wanted to be the ideal fan, I wanted to support DE every step of the way but I can't anymore. Every single person I have played this game with has left me in the dust and moved onto bigger and better things, and here I am typing my solemn farewell. So goodbye DE, farewell my dearest Loki. I have nothing left to give, and I am growing tired. Let me know when Warframe 2 comes out.",0.815237641334533691

The gameplay is top tier and after you get through the difficulty of learning the in game systems, it has so much depth and allows for so much creativity. However, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to potential new players. The on-boarding experience, while improved over the years is still pretty bad. They teach you the gameplay well enough, but then throw you into a frankenstein's monster of systems that they did not put nearly enough effort into explaining. There are also so many vestigial systems. As a new player, you might find yourself pouring in time to understand one of these bastardized systems to only to find out that it's out-dated and been unsupported for years. (looking at you archwings among other things) They really could stand to invest some time and money into improving the onboarding experience for new players. Clean up/remove unused systems, optimize the current ones and create worthwhile tutorials for them. New content is great for us who have played for hundreds of hours, but I feel like they would do themselves more good if they spent some extra time and money on the early game. There is a reason only 40% of players have gotten to the 2 hour mark of this game and this is the biggest reason why. I wish this was a game I could recommend to not only others on steam, but to my friend group. As it stands now, I cannot.",0.805595099925994873
English,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Awaken as an unstoppable warrior and battle alongside your friends in this story-driven free-to-play online action game,Digital Extremes,Warframe,Digital Extremes,"Hi hello, I will try to explain to you how to approach this game. 1 - How the game progresses and where the problems begin; First 200 hours : Pure bliss, amazing game, the movement, weapons, warframes, quests the community and oh all this and that. It is genuinely great, very addictive. Pretty much perfect in every way. The progression is gated in a nice way, microtransactions are not predatory, you can even earn the premium currency without spending money! 200-500 hours : You begin to understand the game more, enjoy it on a more technical and nuanced level, so many cool interactions, great depth to everything. Maybe you even dip your toes into some ""competetive"" aspects of the game. You manage to spot some of the mistakes the devs made, not too many, but they still are there. You begin to become a bit jaded. 500-1000 hours : Many of the more intricate interactions between weapons, warframes, mods and operator, back of your hand. Second nature. You begin to notice how little the developers play their own game, spot more of their mistakes, maybe even try to do something about it. You truly start to understand where the problems lie, what should be fixed, what needs to change, or at least you think so. You start getting annoyed with the developers incompetence. 1000-2000 hours : You just keep playing the game, hoping that some things change, get better. You see the game fall apart into pieces, at this point you have absolutely nothing positive to say about the game. Try as you might, you will change nothing, the game you loved is no longer what it used to be. You see the community you once treasured turn toxic, overconfident and egocentric. 2000-3000 hours : You very well might have a good grasp on how the game truly works, and how truly broken and half assed it is. You begin to understand that the previous ""horrible errors"" are incredibly minor in comparison to the underlying issues that the game has. You see that it is heading off of a cliff, and nobody will do anything about it. You see the true colors of developers, their lies, empty promises, laziness. It dawns on you how far gone the game you used to play is. 3000-5000 hours : You truly see how bad it is, you compare the game to what it was yesterday and it only gets worse. Content getting removed, watered down. Players getting abused for just playing the game, gamebreaking glitches not being fixed and swept under the rug. You see how little they care. For me it was the end, and it will stay that way for good. The first few hundred hours got me helplessly addicted, I still long for the game I used to play way back then. And before some dimwit comes out and says something about ""nostalgia goggles"", its not that, it is not even remotely close to that. It has gotten progressively worse and worse as the time went on. The game got very empty, all of the challenge left, every aspect of the game got watered down. Everyone is a winner taken to an extreme. 2 - Who am I and how I played the game; Started out just like everyone else, casually having fun, scrubbing around. Best days of my warframe life. Fully captivated by the movement, scenery, story, basically with everything the game had to offer. It was great, loved every bit of it. The first day I put on 14 hours, the game had me. After I got done with the starchart, fully kitted out my favorite weapons and waframes, I searched for something more. At first, I found it. Enjoyed the speedrunning, even had a few world records for all that's worth. Cracked down on endurance runs, I ran a solo survival for 5 days, played the game till it broke. Literally, the game engine started dying. And here laid the very first problem. During my endurance adventures, I caught a few trade restrictions. I got banned from trading because of ""unusual mission results"", two week ban after every ""unusual"" mission. And those were not hard to come by honestly. This is the first game I have ever played that chastised players for playing it. Scoffed it off at first, whatever, right? I kept playing, doing my thing, sometimes even dipping my toes into the forbidden lands of The Conclave, which I began to enjoy tremendously. Then the decline started, status changes, warframe reworks and rebalances, newer operations, enemy rebalancing. After a certain point every single update I played was either a letdown, recycled or a net loss for the game. Pieces of the game started disappearing, skill ceiling was getting lowered, the community started getting toxic. Past a certain point I could extract no more enjoyment from PvE, they took it ALL away. So I moved on, PvP. I loved it, played the fuck out of it. It had its problems, but hey, we made it work. WE. The community is truly great, knowledgeable, charitable and willful to help out. So I got hooked again, ground out the skills, got really good. At my peak I was one of the best in the period I was playing, and a very good player when it came to the overall gamemode. I helped others get their feet off the ground, made them enjoy the game with me. So many great people I met there, and a lot of them I will miss from this day onwards.To whom it may concern, if you are reading this, you know who you are. I want to thank you for every game we played together, and all the moments we spent in annihilation. You are a part of my life that I will never forget. Thank you so much.Even though the gamemode was not popular at all, we had around 100 people playing actively, some of them INCREDIBLY skilled, professional quake players, top 10 aimers on Kovaaks, insane players. If you could bear the bad balancing, incredibly high skill ceiling, you had an amazing experience that was never and will never be replicated anywhere else. A great arena shooter with amazing flow, movement, feel. It was by far my favorite game ever, and it will always be. But oh well, when it comes to warframe, all good things need to end at some point. Even though the gamemode at this point was not being actively worked on by any developer, not even the one or two that were assigned part time. PvE changes bled through and broke it, shield gate, melee block, falloff bugs, imbalanced EHP warframes, and oh so more. Some weapons went from fine, to dealing damage that could kill the tankiest warframe 5 times over. It was all in shambles now, everything. No game left undisturbed by the telos boltace ragdoll, wolf sledge instakill AoE, tigris prime crossmap oneshots. No game left untouched by the horrible melee 3.0 system that completely broke all melee weapons, shieldgating completely ruining the whole dynamic of the game. Piece by piece, yet again, the game I loved was being torn apart. But I did not want to let go, I continued. We would deal with it like we used to, right? We could manage the exploiters back in the day, shouldn't be much different now. But I saw faces fade, people leave, friends fall out. It was too much, even for them. But I continued, I wanted to uphold it. I wanted to show people that this gamemode is something worth playing, and fighting for. I took it upon myself, I even made accounts to fight off recruit conditioning bullies picking on MR0 firstcomers, goddamnit made a whole clan dedicated to it. Made communities around it, I really wanted to make it work. This was my last stand, the last thing that kept me playing this godforsaken game. Alas, after some time it was enough even for me. I took a break, and today I came back from it. To see Conclave in a state even worse than it was left at, the fps issues worsened, freezing grew more frequent. It was the final straw. They did it, for the second time now. Ruined it all. This time without even trying at all. Today is the last day. Keep in mind, there still are more problems, but sadly the character limit hit. So, should you play it? No. Not for long anyway, take the first 200 and run far away.",0.804092228412628174
English,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Awaken as an unstoppable warrior and battle alongside your friends in this story-driven free-to-play online action game,Digital Extremes,Warframe,Digital Extremes,"As a player who has actually played for a long time (MR26, almost 27 before I quit, all frames, including Primes except Excal Prime), and who has spent money into the game for Tennogen, I have to say that at the end of the day, I really cannot recommend this game to anyone out there who seeks to play it. On the surface, the developers seem to be nice people who listen to the feedback of the players, and there seems to be a relatively welcoming community free of toxicity. But look past this gilded surface, and you start to see the problems that actually plague this game. Firstly, it is obvious enough that the developers are trying to market this game in a revolving door fashion. You go in, play, get everything, get bored and quit. The crap about ""Fashionframe is end game"" and ""just play your 3 hour survival for challenge"", it is really a terrible way to retain players as there's no tangible reward for attempting to perform above and beyond. You reach the end of the content soon and the game soon turns into nothing but endless grind to upgrade many weapons which are just slightly adjusted stat tweaks of each other in different skins. The Devs do not care about long time players who have put many hours of effort into the game, as an actual fact. They want these players out of the game and all the plat and other bought resources to rot away in their accounts, so plat and rivens are taken out of circulation, while hoping new players will come in and pay. Secondly, the way the devs devalue player efforts by making excuses that the game is always in Beta and the Riven System is subject to change. Rivens are as a whole an end game chase for the bored players who have nothing to do. It gives them something to farm for, in the form of Kuva, to always try and push the stats a bit higher. But when dispositions and adjusted, all the hard work put by veterans into the rivens vanish overnight. Weapons should never be balanced by popularity, but by actual power. Also, when frames or guns which are released strong to attract plat sales, but later nerfed to make way for the new release, it's no different from power creep, except disguised. You don't make the new deal stronger, you make everything weaker. The frame reworks as well, forcing players to keep up with forma use as a poor effort at player retention, it isn't something that should be welcome. Thirdly, much of the content turns out either to not cater to the player base, or ridiculously buggy and unplayable. The Story Quests turned out to be full of problems on release, while game modes like Arbitrations and Sanctuary Onslaught were plagued by similar problems. There is no pre-release testing by a proper team of testers, and instead they depend on players testing the game. Do you all see the logic in this? People are paid to test games in general as Quality Assurance, but why are we as players paying either with time or money to test the game for Digital Extremes? Rather than enjoy working content, why must we earn working content? The obsession with pumping out new content also leaves many old pieces of content unfixed and buggy, with the logic that they will eventually get around to it. It's been years, though, and the only things they fixed were ""wonky calculations"" that allowed weapons to do more damage than they were supposed to. Or rather, nerfs are hidden as bug fixes ... while some bugs are simply turned into features. Digital Extremes only fixes what is convenient to them to fix, not what needs fixing. Fourthly, the community of Warframe isn't as nice as its silvered surface would suggest. Many within blindly defend the choices of Digital Extremes, but constitute a minority who drown out the voices of the other players who may have suggestions to improve the game. They only believe that Digital Extremes can be right, and they decide that they may dictate how the game will be played. It doesn't require a visit to the Warframe Forums to know of this. You'll spot the white knights shouting down all other players wherever there is criticism of the game. You may just be saying I'm some player who is salty about my toys being taken away, but I counter this by saying that I paid for the toys with my time and money. You can as well if you were willing to put in effort, and I am sure many long time players have the same experience as me. As a long time player of the game, who has provided steadfast support over quite a long span of the game's existence, I believe I have at least the right to voice my opinion about what's going wrong with the game and why I left the game. Too long, didn't read? Basically the Devs give jack about their real supporters and don't care. Nobody listens to longtime players and we are treated as trash to be taken out. Don't fall into the same trap and waste the same time as I wasted on this atrocious game made by people who don't give a damned about you.",0.799883663654327393
English,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Awaken as an unstoppable warrior and battle alongside your friends in this story-driven free-to-play online action game,Digital Extremes,Warframe,Digital Extremes,"Review from a veteran player. (6 years played so far) After playing for long I just can't recommend this game anymore mainly because of this reasons: They don't care about keeping players into their game, they just care about new players; evey patch note, every hotfix, every big mainline update is about new players. YES! I know its a business and they need to have people interested in their game but hey 6 years and every update is dedidacated to them for us vets what is there for us to do? NOTHING, there is no endgame, we used to have raids but hey they removed those so yeah... ""O hey but fashionframe is endgame""... dude for real just stop saying that its not funny anymore. We were promised something close to and endgame and that was sanctuary onslaugh BUT HEY they made it so new players could play it as well and... yep in the end it turned out to become a place where you lvl up your stuff... DUDE WE ALREADY HAD THE METHODS FOR THAT!! Kuva lich system came out but NOP don't think that this system is endgame, you only get to either kill you lich to get a weapon with bonus elemental damage (the bonus % is rng...) or you convert your lich to help you in battle (if you do this you get an ephemera) and thats it... why would we grind hoping to get the weapon we want with that 60% elemental damage, just to grind AGAIN for the relics to grind AGAIN to get the mods for the parazon just to keep doing ""tryal and error"" again and again and again and again and again... Warframe nowadays just adds more grind and more rng on top of the OTHER layers of rng and grind that we already had to compensate for the lack of content. O whats that you are a new player and you just want to play the new railjack content? welp too bad for you you need to wait 12 hrs for each part to finish ""o and how many parts?"" 6. YEP! you have to grind for all of this NEW resources that they introduce every big update so yeah have fun in getting your own railjack after all of that. ""o but that means you didn't farm for it and you are complaining about warframe just because of this"" nop, I did grind for it, I experienced railjack and burning tides since day 1; one of the worst experience I've had in a video game so far... no joke trully atrocius. Railjack is a buggy mess its a rushed content that was only release because of the hype of game awards... I don't care that NOW they are adding hotfixes, they had the time to work for this and the fact that they released it this way... just no dude... its a joke even from the point of view of a business model its just dumb... no one would have take the decision that they took. Another reason why I don't recommend this game its mainly because of an epidemy... WHITE-KNIGHTS. DE tends to listen to this part of the community, and why? welp because they won't criticize the game they always say that ""waframe is perfect, warframe has no flaws""... sure buddy just look at how warframe is not in the top 10 of steam anymore lul. And for those thinking ""o you are just burned out"" no... I'm not... I have been playing warframe constantly, the thing is Its hard for me to keep up with so much BS from the community and devs alike. Now its true, I should have more hours after 6 years of playing 4k+ at least but I started playing Warframe when I was about to enter college and yeah I have been very bussy since then. And lastly why I don't recommend this game? welp cause trade chat. (I won't put more arguments for this after all its not worth it anymore...) If you have a time machine, go back to 2015 and play the game after all, those were the glory days. Since plains of eidolon came out all went downhill in terms of content release, mayor bugs, unpolished updates, etc etc... So long story short, I can't recommend a looter shooter that has the ""bad kind of grind"" to keep itself releveant. The grind in this game its not rewarding at all, you just grind because its there and thats it... Now whats left for Warframe in 2020? idk and I don't care I just lost the small light of hope that I had for this game, the game has potential but thats it, till this day devs decide to leave it like that ""its has potential"" and then... that ""potential"" stays there... they just leave it there and add more stuff on top of it... yeah they add potential on top of more potential. Am I quitting warframe? Idk, but I'm sure that I won't be spending money even if I have a discount or the money to buy a tennogen item, I just don't feel like supporting this game anymore. I might play it or maybe I won't I just dont know anymore... remember when warframe used to laugh at destiny 2? yeah... me too kid... me too...",0.787601351737976074
English,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Awaken as an unstoppable warrior and battle alongside your friends in this story-driven free-to-play online action game,Digital Extremes,Warframe,Digital Extremes,"I've been playing this game on and off in the last decade ever since the game was available to public. Every once in a while, I'd hear about the game having a huge update and would come back, just to play for a few weeks and quit wondering why I even bothered at all. And that's the problem with this game which made me find it hard to recommend the game at all. Having the grind at its core, Warframe over its course has been updated with systems upon systems that require you to grind for the sake of the grind. There's not really any content challenging enough that you HAVE to bring that maxed out shiny frame with five-times-prestiged weapon to. It's a game about mindless slaughtering hordes of trash mobs and that's just all fine and dandy. But constantly adding content to a game bloated with 10 years worth of content is no small feat, much less tweaking older content to a good spot alongside that effort. And my heart goes to the developer, they've tried really hard, but the longer it goes, the more obvious that the developer got into way over their heads and are gradually utilizing more and more tricks to force people to play their game all the while buying time for their next update by making the grind as obnoxious as possible. Had I written this review before November, I probably would have left a Recommended review with some caveat, but the latest blunder that the developer committed has pushed me off the edge into the red territory: the Aya system. No amount of 75% off for next platinum purchase coupon can fix this. For those who aren't familiar with the game, Warframe has a plethora of weaponry in the form of titular warframes and weapons that you can use to commit war crime in space. There are regular weaponry, and then there are Prime weaponry. Prime warframes are just normal warframes but shinier and has a different look. Prime weapons are often straight up upgrades. These prime weaponry are available for a limited time before they are ""vaulted"" where they can no longer be organically obtained. When a prime item is not vaulted, you can do various ingame activities to obtain relics that contain those prime items, then you have to open relic in a lootbox manner to obtain those items. Each item has several parts, some are common, some are rare. When a prime item is vaulted, these relics no longer drop. A little bit of history, before this relic system was in the game, prime items could be obtained as reward from a specific series of maps called the Orokin Tower where you can use a key to get access to, there were 4 tiers and the higher the tier, the higher the part rarity. The reason why the relic system and the vaulting procedure was introduced was because the developer wanted to avoid a diluted drop pool, as they were introducing new prime items faster and faster, and you can understand why having 60 different items each with 3-6 parts dropping from 4 missions is a bad, bad idea. Cue the Aya system update, an event where instead of relic drop, the in-game activities will drop Aya which the players can use to exchange for the relics that contain the parts of a prime item the player want instead. That means that the entire vaulting system where they wanted to adopt to avoid diluting the drop table was completely fixed. One would think that that's a positive thing. And it is. Except the developer implemented it as a one off event and still designed it around a Fear Of Missing Out. In this event, all the relics that contain vaulted items can be obtained again, but only 2 weeks for each set of item, and only for a few weeks. This has been the developer's modus operandi for years. They introduce a system that's ridden with problem, people complain and put up with it, until they can't anymore and the developer finally caves and starts working on changes. Meanwhile they make use of FOMO to keep players playing, buying time for their next big thing and be showered in praise for doing one good thing after a series of barely comprehensible decisions. The latest changes regarding nerfing the massive material sink in the Helminth system, the frankly annoying releveling process while a player forma an item, the new player experience, etc... (which are all too long to explain) are all results of years of players and reviewers such as Josh Strife Hayes and Brozime complaining about how absolutely unfriendly to the player they are. I love the core game to death, it has just the right gunplay and the movement system. They have a wonderful foundation, but everything that they built around it is ugly, clunky and just minimally functional enough to keep the game together and for the players to play while they work on fixing it 5 years down the line. And that's not too mention the predatorial business practice which has never manifested itself as clearly as the latest Regal Aya controversy, which they so shamelessly lied through their teeth about before backpedaling and implemented the changes to appease the player base. Frankly at this point I don't recommend playing the game. People tell you this game will consume so much of your time as if it's a good thing. I'm here to tell you it's not. If you play this game, you'll be playing just to get mad at a system being completely backwards and inconvenient, yet keep playing anyway because ""maybe they'll fix it soon, they just fix X system last update, give them some time"" and/or ""if I don't play right now and get these stuffs I'll have to pay an astronomical price for it later when it's not naturally obtainable anymore"". If you really REALLY want to play the game, go ahead, but I wouldn't recommend investing too much of yourself into this game.",0.781765282154083252
English,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Awaken as an unstoppable warrior and battle alongside your friends in this story-driven free-to-play online action game,Digital Extremes,Warframe,Digital Extremes,"I have a severe love hate relationship with warframe, it’s a long read tldr at the bottom I’m a “grandmaster founder”, I’ve been playing off and on since the beginning of 2013 and I’ve seen just how different the games changed for better and for worse. You play in third person, as a warframe a “space ninja” where you kill everything in your way with a ton of different weapons or abilities as you chase the green finish line mark on your map, this gives you loot, you use the loot to craft more toys and the process repeats; this can either be done solo or with up to three more people for a total of four. To keep this relatively simple here is what I like about warframe • Warframe’s art is unique and many people spend huge amounts of time coloring their gear, between picking a frame, what three weapons it’ll use and then what it’ll wear almost turns into a dress up game all on its own. The levels look great and get better each time the dev’s take a look at them usually adding new effects and rooms to fight in. The enemies you fight (while kinda stale) all look good and can be cut into pieces, burnt to ashes, melted, electrocuted, smashed into the distance or frozen which while not anything groundbreaking, does lead to some memorable moments. • Warframe’s combat is fast paced and varied in what you can use to fight your way through hordes of soldiers, robots, or space zombies. Jumping ahead at what feels like 60 mph to swing a great sword at the head of some poor sob never really seemed to lose its appeal. • Warframes payment scheme is mostly pretty forgiving, you can earn things in-game by working for them, if you want them quicker there’s always the option of tossing some money at the screen. Unfortunately these two areas are all that really shined for me, some things to think about before you jump into the game. • Warframe hardly ever tries to explain itself to new players. A game where the wiki is more helpful than the tutorial. Fortunately the community loves to take newer players under their wings. However when new mechanics are introduced the players are on their own to figure it out or get help from other players who simply took the punches. • Warframe is a grind that can wear down players pretty quickly depending on what their goals are. If you happen to like the wrong weapon you may be in for some punishment while you pray to the RNG gods for the right key to get that last piece with a drop rate of 0.12%. Looking at recent additions, attitudes and past experience points towards this grind only getting worse in the future. • The Dev’s for warframe (D.E.) are very fickle to put it politely. They’ll add something great only to muddy it up with ill thought out details or what feels like a rushed job. A recent example would be a new gun, the Hema, which is costing years’ worth of resources to build in an attempt to drain the player’s stock piles or force them to pump currency into the game to bypass this. On one hand stockpiles need to be drained so your players don’t chew through new content too quickly. On the other hand there are better ways of doing this than with a swift kick to the teeth. D.E. will leave the gun as is until sales drop, and then they’ll adjust the costs to avoid the community’s ire. This has happened numerous times and for some including me, these practices intentional or not are a turn off. If not for their excellent community manager Rebecca this game would not be where it is today with the way DE does things. • If you’re a solo player you will put out more effort and time for less pay off than a group of four players who do less yet gain more, many times an event has happened and it’s been impossible for solo players to even attempt due to bad design (which is thankfully hotfixed in a day or two). Warframe is made as a co-op game; it only allows you to solo as an option so keep this in mind if you have a bad internet connection. • Warframe is FILLED with forgotten mechanics and half assed ideas that were all left to rot. Heres a list within a list of some of these. 1. Clans 2. Archwing 3. Codex/Scanning 4. Syndicates 5. Relays 6. The focus system 7. Channeling 8. Invasions 9. Solor Rails and solor rail conflicts 10. Operators 11. Raids 12. Rivens 13. Rathuum 14. Soon to be: the infested room • Warframe has little to no balance to it. The newest guns will almost always be among the strongest to drive sales. This eventually phases out old favorites since they simply can’t function well enough in higher level content. A majority of the weapons in warframe have ended up as garbage thanks to power creep TLDR Is warframe a good game? Yes it is, you can see a lot of work and passion goes into it, unfortunately this is muddied by the devs themselves with their decisions and the way they handle things. I actively warn people about warframe so I cannot “recommend” it. 2016 was a bad year for Warframe and the future dosen't look too promising either.",0.779323816299438477
English,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Awaken as an unstoppable warrior and battle alongside your friends in this story-driven free-to-play online action game,Digital Extremes,Warframe,Digital Extremes,"""Would you recommend this game to other players?"" - After 2000 hours, no. The game has been available for ten years, every argument pro and contra has already been made. So for brevity's sake I'll reduce it to those four points most important to me: 1) The random number generator day-one frustrations are the same on day-one-hundred and day-one-thousand. Yes, you don't have to pay for anything with real money, but you pay with your time. DE once stated that they never wanted it to be a slot machine, but that's what it is. The majority of time is spent on you pulling the lever over and over (most prominent example being Rivens). That is the core mechanic. Not jumping and shooting, but chance. 2) The incremental release ""game as a service"" business model means you cannot ever know what you're getting, and the direction the game is developed towards is infamously inconsistent. My read has always been that this was intended to keep the developers engaged, so instead of them leaving to work on a spaceship game, or a Souls-like, or something with mechs, DE just squeezed a poorly-made version of those other games in here. I understand that Warframe as-is has successfully financed the company, and that the following would have been unwise from a business standpoint for DE, but tying up the game a few years ago and instead starting clean with a ""Warframe 2"" that has a clearly defined scope would have made for better products. Warframe does one thing very well, and a million things poorly. As another consequence of its historical growth, the game is full of (semi-)abandoned or just poorly aged content, in some cases so crude that you can't show it to anyone because it makes the whole game look bad. The years of difference are painfully visible. Players engaging with new content first (e.g. Duviri wyrm boss) and later encountering old content (e.g. Sergeant, Tyl Regor, Phorid, etc....) must feel like they've accidentally stepped into a different game - essentially, they do. There's no incentive for DE to invest time into reworking this old content, so there's a built-in ""culture shock"". 3) The core gameplay soon becomes completely monotonous because a) waves of uniform enemies run towards you in a straight line, to ineffectively fall over dead, and b) because most missions are not structured - there's just randomly connected rooms and hallways, with enemies spawning from thin air, and once you have pressed the button you are supposed to press or killed enough enemies to reach a certain counter, you just run towards the end of the random chain of rooms to finish the mission. But for a few exceptions (like Kuva Fortress Assault), most missions have no story, no stakes, no structure. 4) The story as of recent years. This is what did it for me. Warframe had sparks of brilliance when it comes to sifting stories out of the rich and engaging lore they have built up over the years. For example, the twist introduced in The Second Dream works incredibly well. The narrative highlight for me was The Sacrifice, genuinely one of the most satisfying stories I've seen in a videogame. But that was released in 2018. Beginning with The New War, it all crashed and burned. Using ""parallel dimension to the rescue"" (Eternalism), ""none of it is real you just made it up, none of this matters"" (Duviri), teasing big events just to skip over them entirely (New War), and inconsistently reintroducing characters (Erra, Vor) has made the narrative so thin and weak, that there's no clear threat, no clear motivation, just a tangled mess of storylines that slapped against the void-wall at full speed. Warframe is a huge sunk cost fallacy. There's a kernel of a fantastic action game with a grand sci-fi story in there, but it's buried under layers and layers of grind, distractions, meaningless time-sinkholes, and unfinished dead ends. That's the most frustrating part about it - everyone who gets deeply into it will have dozens of ideas on how to fix it - because it's obvious that it needs fixing, and that there's something there worth saving.",0.774407565593719482

A roguelike action game from the creators of Curse of the Dead Gods©, playable solo or in online co-op.",Passtech Games,Ravenswatch,Nacon,"Since Curse of the Dead Gods, I'm a big fan of this studio. I like their Mignola-esque art style, the enemy design, the pacing of combats, their sound design, and OSTs. CotDG became my favorite Roguelike. There's a lot to like in Ravenswatch, mostly the diverse characters/playstyles available, but I want to give an honest review about the CURRENT STATE of the game. I might switch it to positive at the end of the EA period, but right now I'm frustrated and I don't want to lure potential buyers like a fanboy. To put it simply, I think the game needs at least 3 times its current amount of content to feel like a complete, satisfying game and/or proper Roguelike. They've been creative with the open-world roguelike formula; I admire that even if the UX is a bit poor, but I can't help myself but feel I'm playing the first 20% of something that should be massively bigger. It's quite fun to play, but in some way, it plays/feels like an online Diablo-like, and if you consider all the similarities with that genre, it terribly suffers from the comparison. The progression system is very limited, and the gameplay lacks depth. There's barely anything to unlock, and in two games, I feel I've seen nearly everything I could learn about a playable character. What a shame. As I said earlier, I love their core concepts, but the experience of playing them lacks depth and variables. Playing the nameless hero from Curse of the Dead Gods is more satisfying, diverse, and deeper than all the characters I tried from Ravenswatch. In Ravenswatch, I can just spam the same combos over and over, more or less. It's very repetitive, I don't have to think that much about the fights or the builds. CotDG was much more thinky than that. The other non-negligible problem currently is the fragility of the matchmaking. There are dead hours where you wait forever (without any feedback) to find teammates. You don't even know which settings you should select to increase the odds of the matchmaking. So you're forced to use the discord to find some players currently available to play on the difficulty you want. It sucks, and I suspect it will get worse halfway between the major updates. Yes, it can potentially improve, but the truth is that it's annoying RIGHT NOW. My suggestions for the future of this game: This game doesn't need new characters. It needs depth and real variety. I checked the roadmap and based on CotDG's lifespan, I suspect the studio doesn't have the funds to support the game for multiple years of content, which is unfortunate because the game aggressively needs more content. This is why I honestly believe additional characters should be (should have been) DLCs while the content updates remain free. This is the only way I can see Ravenswatch reaching its full potential. And yes, I would pay for every DLCs because these devs are good. It's just that the game needs A LOT more to keep the players engaged. Buy the game only if you want to support the dev team. Don't buy it thinking you'll get a solid gameloop that will keep you engaged for a while. It's not there yet.",0.778344392776489258

A roguelike action game from the creators of Curse of the Dead Gods©, playable solo or in online co-op.",Passtech Games,Ravenswatch,Nacon,"I played solo for a bit and got my first impressions. What feels good - The visuals and sounds are top-notch — shoutout to those artists for absolutely nailing it. - Combat and controls are smooth and responsive. - The dark atmosphere and the overall vibe are authentic and unique, which is one of the most sought-after features. What feels weird/bad - A ticking timer does not contribute significantly to the fun, as when it runs out, you get immediately teleported to the boss. Your time is always ticking no matter where or what you are doing, except if you are on the map menu. So there's really no room to safely consider your options. Picking up an upgrade? Pick it up quicker as you're on a timer. Considering items in the shop? C'mon, move already, time runs out. - I still have no clue what recovering the black raven statue does. Everything stays the same visually, and no explanation is given, or I missed something. - There's no point in breaking down surroundings - tables, barrels, boxes, etc. - as, sadly, there's not even a tiny loot from it. - I played almost exclusively with Snow Queen, and it felt rather punishing. She's slow and clunky, though she might wipe the entire packs of mobs if positioned well. Some mobs (like fat worms with ray attack) may get you no matter how skillful you move, rendering you unable to avoid the attack. - The boss fight is so frustrating. It's nowhere near the feeling of boss fights in Curse of the Dead Gods, where bosses present a solid challenge, but their patterns are well-readable, and they're totally beatable. Even with destroying a tumor and reducing the boss's HP by 20%, I couldn't get it close to being defeated. Sometimes, I had a feeling of getting killed w/o noticing what hit me. Regular tendrils hit hard; the central tendril one-shots you. Plus, you need to dodge bullets, lightning bolts, and ground attacks during the fight. It's not fun and feels too much for the first boss, especially with a hero like Snow Queen. - Adding some condition icons or other visual cues to enemies with chilled status would be great. Playing Snow Queen revolves around chilling and shattering enemies, which requires you to distinguish visually who's chilled to attack/shatter them effectively. And those tiny little snowing animation isn't enough, obviously. - Cooldowns for skills should be stated in the skill description. - From what I've seen, there are just a few upgrades, just differing in order. Even though there was only one character in Curse of the Dead Gods, the variety of weapons adds to replayability and the feeling of interesting, fresh runs. Here, it starts feeling samey pretty fast. This is crucial since that's what makes roguelikes like The Binding of Isaac a timeless classic — its variety of possible item/skills/set/trinket combos. You can play for 100 hours and then suddenly get surprised with something unexpected and exciting. And it goes on and on for every room you enter. - I tried the beta branch to see the next chapter and after defeating the boss and choosing to go next, the game has closed. So there's not much to see here for the given price. Hopefully, all the bad will be refined, and the game gets better.",0.704484879970550537

I just want to reiterate what other players have said already in hopes the devs will see this. Having the timer not stop during upgrades or at shops is such a hindrance to my experience. I love creating builds but feeling rushed while doing so is just really unfortunate. I also wish the timer would pause while talking to NPSs/at shops. I don't mind the timer mechanic as a whole but I really hope they update it to pause during those above instances.

But I think outside of saying you completed a run as a certain character, there isn't much reason to playing further. I think the game needs a better reward system and progression loop. As you level up each character, you unlock new abilities that you can possibly get in the next run, but there's no guarantee those abilities will actually be better than the old ones. So you just have a larger pool of possible perks with no way to really pick the ones you want. In fact, if you like the lower level skills, your odds of getting them become less and less as you level up as the pool gets bigger and bigger. I feel they should incorporate some things that other similar games have already incorporated. Maybe passive stats that you can permanently unlock, or the ability to reroll or banish unwanted skills. Basically, I feel they need to add something into the gameplay loop to make you feel that by upgrading your character overall, you might have an advantage on your next run over your previous run. And you should also feel that by getting far in a given run offers a tangible reward over a much shorter run that will help you in future runs. It's the kind of mechanic look forward to the grind and keep trying. If after your 20th run you're not really any better off than you were in your first run, it kind of disincentivizes me from looking forward to the next run, let along a long grind. And maybe by adding passive upgrades, that means they need to make further stages harder to balance out later stages to keep up with the fact that players will be getting stronger the longer they play. But at least then, they will have reason to want to keep playing. This game has some really good things going for it and I hope they can add something to the gameplay loop to really make it take off.",0.673609256744384766

The overall gameplay loop seems like it would be really fun, but the 1 thing that makes me not recommend the game and it's a completely biased reason so take this review with a grain of salt. It's simply the fact that you are on a timer and when that time is over (which is a really short timer) you have to fight the chapter boss, there's no way around this. so unless you play sweaty af you are probably going into the boss fight under leveled. you have a relatively large map to scour, albeit, with waypoints at your disposal. I guess my gripe with this mechanic is that you don't get anytime to actually enjoy playing the game, hell even every time you level up and try to make a choice with the ability power up you want the timer still ticks down? like why??? its idle time. I'm forced to play this game a speed that is not enjoyable at all.

The game overall is pleasant and enjoy the dark fantasy aesthetic paired with characters from classic stories and myth. At present in February 2024, however, it's still too unpolished to really be worth buying. You are dumped into the game without any tutorials or descriptions of what things do. It wasn't until I watched some videos on how to play online that I realized the healing wells not only heal you but raise your health level. The present gameplay design is a bit counter-intuitive. The way to play, as described in many videos, is to avoid the mobs all over the map in favor of getting the events that add skills and enhancements in the same way drops did in Hades. This means that, in a game littered with mobs everywhere you go, your objective is to ignore them instead of fighting them. So you have a combat game with combat skills that ideally involves... er... avoiding combat. The problem is that fighting mobs wastes the 20 or so minutes you have before the Big Bad shows up and you have to fight it. The result is that it becomes a fetch quest kind of play in which you're basically trying to gather up goodies while not getting pulled into fights. It's like a mix of combat without engaging in combat and stealth without any actual stealth. This problem is exacerbated by the Fog of War covering the map, meaning you're also supposed to explore to find the things you actually want while avoiding all of the mobs around you. It's a lot to do in 20 minutes. There will probably be many that enjoy this style of ""F- around and find out"" gameplay and that's totally valid. It actually is kind of interesting to kick the tires of this game and see what does what. But it can also leave you feeling pretty lost. It'd be nice if the developers could find a sweet spot between absolutely no real guidance and being led about by the nose in an annoying series of tutorial pop ups. Ultimately, it just feels like the game is a big mess with no real clarity as to what kind of game it's supposed to be. Avoiding mobs in order to focus on a treasure hunt in order to fight one BIG battle at the end isn't really all that fun. I can see the point in strategically picking your battles, but then why litter the map with enemies and giving you a bunch of combat skills if your best move is to not fight? Part of this might be addressed by powering down many of the mobs because all but the smallest of them wind up being huge time sucks. I'm hoping this game will acquire more polish in time and get clear on what kind of playstyle it wants to present. I love the aesthetic and hated to do a refund, but it's just too much of a messy mishmash right now to be worth keeping, even at the $16 price point I got it for. I'll keep my eye on it over time but, for now, it's just too much pointless stuff thrown into a blender.",0.594671249389648438

I played Ravenswatch completely solo and never touched co-op so my experience is solely single player and I've finished all difficulties with Beowulf, Aladdin and Scarlet. The gameplay itself is great. It responds well and once you get a rhythm down with your favorite character you feel like a well-oiled evil slaying machine, but I have 2 gripes that slowly grew into a complaint that slowly made me enjoy the game less and less. First is the 3 in-game days/18 minutes per area time limit, I get that time is of the essence evil is awakening and the heroes must respond theme of the game but I just hate being rushed since I'm the completionist/take your time in a single area type of player so being rushed from point A to point B to Point C is something I personally don't like, while I know people enjoy that choose your upgrades/items to prioritize before the boss awakens I wish there was also a customization feature to allow me to disable the timer and let me take my time and enjoy the view or learn a new hero. Second complaint is that most talent unlocks after the base talent feels weak/made some heroes weaker e.g. Beowulf. I finished all the difficulties with Beowulf using his base talents and I loved his base kit, but after getting his new talent that enhances his shield abilities I just failed run after run not because it was a skill issue but because I got his talents that enhances the shielding instead of the usual power/special upgrade to my sword swings or spin attack and I get that's the point of roguelikes/lites you're just really gonna get fucked sometimes whether you like it or not but having only 2 choices of talents every level up and adding more talents you don't want expanded the talent pool really took me out of it. Aside from those 2 main complaints I have I really like this game and I'll check it out every major update hoping for at least a custom mode to solve my whining.",0.592233896255493164

Amazing aesthetics, cool voice acting, solid hero designs, good game controls and a fluid combat. In terms of the general feeling of the world it offers, it does not fall short of The Curse of the Dead Gods. Absolutely better in a limited number of areas. However the game is also frustrating to an extent. It feels like it was balanced with only co-op in mind. In my 2 hours of solo experience with The Snow Queen and The Pied Piper, it just felt... unrewarding? Unreasonably punishing? I think it would be a $wiser$ choice to lean more towards a rogue-lite genre, rather than a rogue-like one. Even though I loved most of what this game offers, it still felt like a chore after 3-4 attempts. I don't know if it's just my taste, but this difficult introduction was not what I was expecting. There needs to be a power balance for solo gameplays, especially for The Snow Queen. It was just underwhelming. I could even call The Pied Piper overpowered compared to that. Just one dodge? I mean why? Introduce a stamina system like you have in The Curse of the Dead Gods and let us have an even more dynamic combat. Character progression and skill unlocks felt a bit too slow and random, considering the unnecessarly implemented timer/countdown for the boss fight. Speaking of the countdown... again, I'd rather have something similar to the linear room progression in The Curse of the Dead Gods, to reach the boss fight. I get that this game tries to have more of an ""open-world"" type of approach, but what actually is the point of an open-world if I'll just have to run around with a ticking time bomb, rushing to kill as many mobs quickly and unlock some upgrades. If I won't be able to enjoy the ""open"" world, and be forced to rush through it, just make it a linear ""room after room"" system and at least let me play with my desired pacing within those rooms. I'll sadly get a refund for this now, and check back later if these sort of updates have been implemented. Next time I buy, I'd also expect at least a 35-40% discount as well. I honestly hope to see it get improvements and waaay more content (not hero options), and maybe get addicted to it in the future!",0.576946020126342773

A roguelike action game from the creators of Curse of the Dead Gods©, playable solo or in online co-op.",Passtech Games,Ravenswatch,Nacon,"Post Update DPS still feels a bit low/combat feels grindy..ish and slow if you have a bunch of tougher enemies its typically better to just leave rather than try take them out one by one because its not worth the potential HP which shouldnt be the case if your dmg was high enough. Balancing this aspect of the game will be difficult because it would let you make balls of enemies to grind down faster vs picking out stronger ones 1 by 1 etc. Exp is definitely good now. Given how big the map is you'd spend too long scraping for exp rather than exploring the map for upgrades. Upgrades need a bit more balancing some are too low impact, but hey its early access. I don't like how its become harder to get that final wish from the wishing well to get a legendary power which incentives pooling gold to the next chapter to get that pay out as combat can feel slow at times without delaying the first 2 wishes. Pooling gold for wishes would further slow down your ramp up time early game which idk if I like given that a full 2 chapter run rn was about 40 min for me, with additional chapters dmg and exp would need to be adjusted to compensate for longer run length without becoming tedious and exhausting. Adding more events to the map would be interesting that yield specific rewards, maybe even some move speed for better navigation. Such as puzzles, looking for a holy grail or something if you can find all the whatever during a level which would counter act excess time to give you something to spend it on. Additionally idk if this is a thing but going from one level to another should reward players going for speed and convert time left when engaging the last boss to exp. ~~As others have said the recent update adding chapter 2 made the game feel worse in every way possible. You dont have the dps you used to and it seems you get less exp where I struggle to hit level 5 before ending chapter 1 which wasnt the case before. Increasing upgrade costs etc. Cant recommend the game rn~~",0.573094666004180908

A roguelike action game from the creators of Curse of the Dead Gods©, playable solo or in online co-op.",Passtech Games,Ravenswatch,Nacon,"After playing for almost 40 hours, unlocking every hero to max level and unlocking the hardest difficulty I think I can fairly asses this title. As some people have complained, I don't think the game is too difficult. When you pick the right class, right build and learn how to play the game it is quite easy to beat both bosses without dying even once. And you can always play on normal mode instead of difficult mode. However the game does have lot of problems which is why I don't recommend it at this state, however I will change my review if some of these issues are addressed. The timer: The main issue of the timer is not the timer itself but how is it implemented. Time doesn't stop at any time not leaving you a chance to think about your build or items you are picking up. Hell, I even lost many items due to being teleported in the middle of picking of an item when timer expired. The multiplayer: The game struggles finding balance between solo and multiplayer. There are issues with enemies (especially on harder difficulties) that will always one shot you, sometimes due to no fault of your own and the way they are designed to be played with multiple players. However, there are also issues with enemies being super spongy when playing on 4 players mode. Similarly, when you revive you are given 0 time to move around with no invulnerability, resulting in enemies basically spawn camping you and one shotting you once again if you get unlucky. The combat: This is by far the biggest issue at this point as it feels very frustrating and non-responsive most of the time. Unlike other fast pace games, in here you CANNOT cancel out of ANY attack or ability. Once you hit the button you are committed, into sometimes very long 3 - 6 seconds animations and you are stuck in them, welcoming enemies to hit you, snare you or instantly kill you. This wouldn't be an issue if this was a dark-souls like game but it is not. And the combat does not feel like it at all. Not only you should be able to cancel out of most (if not all) attacks and abilities, or dodge your way out of them but also there should be upgrades added to dash and movement speed as your default dodge is very short with high cooldown and apart from one character all movement speed is painfully slow. This translates to my next point. The map exploration: This is the second biggest problem in my opinion. You end up running around the map for majority of the time. Especially on harder difficulties, if you want to win the game you NEED to explore the map first, without fighting any enemies, otherwise you won't have enough time to get enough upgrades and items. Also, the more enemies you fight the more likely you are being one shotted or stunlocked. With the super low movement speed this became a frustrating exercise. After I have explored the map and started to plan I can finally start to enjoy the game but there needs to be a way to address this. Similarly some items are impossible to find unless you are lucky. Keys are randomly placed on the map with no icons on a minimap and if you get unlucky, even if you explore 95% of the map you won't find them. Another issue with exploring the map is enemy aggro. I can't count how many times I had to go back and forth just to loose enemy aggro so I can pick up my item (I'm looking at you spiders). Some enemies will simply chase you half across the map and while that's happening you can't do anything - teleport out to other checkpoints, pick up items, pick up quest items etc. AND when you finally decide to fight them, once they are on low HP they decide to come back to their original position with full HP! Again, this wouldn't be much of an issue if we didn't have to explore the whole map and had limited timer. As if you fought every enemy you encountered not only you would die fast but you would had almost no necessary items needed for final boss. Now, most of these issues became apparent solo play. The Hitboxes: This is by far the most frustrating thing and will make you quit the game multiple times. Enemy attacks and abilities hit you even when you are standing out of animation or effect range/reach. Lasers (which often means instant death) will hit you even if you are standing next to them, dashing through lasers will still kill you and enemy AoE will still hit you even if your small little hair of your character is almost in the area. Enemy with spear attack will hit you when you are outside of their range. Big guy pulling enemy will still pull you even if you are slightly out of their attack cone range. This needs to be adjusted. What you see is not what you get. CC effects: You get very easily stuncloked in one place for a very long time if you play solo as all enemies focus on you. There is no DR on CC effects so you can sit and watch your character die without being able to do anything. This essentially means instant death on harder difficulties and game over. I would say this game has VERY good base to start with and if these issues are solved it could be a very good game. I can see lot of potential despite all of these issues.",0.567714989185333252

In terms of the visuals they are stunning, lovely artwork, interesting enemy design and the voice acting work is very good indeed. However those are the only positives I really have.

Absolutely not but im also not expecting to put next weeks plans on halt when I start a combat encounter. Another problem is the unneeded time restraint which just adds unneeded rush to an already unforgiving combat system and like I said at the start im a solo player now I can't speak for multiplayer obviously but if you're playing solo don't bother it is not balanced in solo and very single player unfriendly.

I had just as much fun pointing and clicking in Syberia: The World Before (Masterclass game), as I did pointing and clicking in D4. This is truly a bells and whistles mobile game with as bare game play as is required to reel consumers in. I spent $0 in their shop, horrible practices. Events are just color changes for enemies/regions, everything else is 100% identical. Aside from the end-game boss loot targeting, there still isn't anything else as mentioned. So the review still stands, and I've now deleted the character completely with no way to recover it, thanks but no thanks Blizzard. - Fun, basic gameplay, with a boring gameplay loop that lacks dopamine hits. *Each class has 4 builds which can be mix and matched. *Sacred Ancestral Unique gear only matches some builds. *Corpses have a small max limit for 2023, damaging two specific builds. *Forgetful, throwaway music, but is good nonetheless and gets the job 'done.' *Gameplay feels over a decade behind the times, lacks innovation. *Inscribing items is the exact same function as the Horadric Cube. *Enchanting items is 5 steps backwards in this game. You can't see what you can change on the affix until you've spent your material and you can't refund them if you choose no affix. *All Armor Sets (Green) were removed and sold in the Shop (with no bonus). *All cool armor & weapon effects from epic sets in past games or even Path of Exile, $. Not a single one for free. Not one. *Archon, Boneweave, and Sovereign armor sets are 99% identical, most sets look pretty similar as well to goad you into the shop. *Game freezes on occasion when loading near other players (when streaming them in). - Feels like the game was made by people who don't play video games. *Always something to do, but always lacking dopamine hits, i.e., the loot is only ever incrementally good except when first accessing a new world difficulty tier. *Altars of Lilith can be completely ignored unless min/maxing as the upgrades give mathematical negative returns almost immediately, regardless of the level scaling. *Mining Ores and doing Herbalism (you just click the deposit/herb, then pick up the item) is required to upgrade Gear and Potions, respectively. *PvP is both Optional (open mouse wheel -> scroll right -> apply Blood Mark) even in the 2 PvP areas and broken due to a flat '92% damage reduction buff,' which means if you did 5,000 damage now you do 400 (8 x 5000) / 100 , so you still kill someone in 1-3 seconds depending on your class and theirs. *PvP marked for blood (enables pvp) can glitch out, preventing you from attacking others but enabling them to attack you (when the glitch occurs, you will not have the particle effect so you won't even know). When glitched you must logout to remove the mark. *PvP is markedly unfinished and poorly thought out, you can reduce pvp damage further by 30% for 20 seconds, but this requires cutting your screen in half with your inventory, then clicking on a tiny box (all mid-battle most likely), then right clicking on a scroll. *PvP is unbalanced for every class and every build, each fight lasting a second, maybe two. *I enjoyed the 'Open World' aspect. From a 3D Designer point of view, it isn't really open world, they simply took 5 Acts of areas and stitched them together, removing the loading screen and mostly hand-crafting the over-world. When taken in this way, the world map isn't really that big, and we loved this, even if it creates a lack of cohesion for the player from a world building perspective (i.e., you can cross Estuar in minutes). *Minus copy paste 'special' bosses to climb the season chapters (which I didn't finish), you have Helltides (Tier 3/4) for targeting loot, Obols (all tiers/from events) for targeting loot, and Nightmare Dungeons (Tier 3/4) for upgrading Paragon board sigils (same function as upgrading gems at the end of a D3 Greater Rift). *Season and in-game content builds on Diablo Immortal, for better or worse, i.e., to complete the Season 2 content, you have to climb to Tier 3 at the least. *The loot you get is the same everywhere, nothing has a specific loot table, minus first time kill rewards, for example, Echo of Lilith. *Tired, boring, cliched, copy-paste story line, trying to be something it's not. Loved Lilith, hated the plot existing to move me from A to B. *Hitting enemies lacks responsive feedback, they just jitter slightly, flash white/silver, or fight right through it. *Sounds of hitting enemies with the physical weapons is lackluster. *Boring, copy paste Affixes for gear. *Great side quests; Horrible voice acting outside the Main Quest. Shameful, especially horrendous as I played Baldur's Gate 3 for 181 hours before this game so it stuck out like a sore thumb. - Store front with skins priced at $38.41 CAD after tax for 1 cosmetic armor set. *Horse armor selling for $23.14 after tax, and WE ALL complained about Bethesda, hah! *Prices normalized by American Companies & Consumers, pressured and forced onto everyone else due to how the global currency exchange works and has functioned for generations; some companies eat this exchange to increase spending in lower GDP countries, see Fatshark with Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, which eats roughly 56% of the conversion rate for the consumer, and this is but one alternative method of targeted pricing as there are many profitable ways to go about this. *No 'Statistics' based research has been used (mathematically even if less than 0.1% buy macrotransactions from Diablo 4's store, they make Real Profit), no transparency between professionals and corporations, every game with MTX stores share the same pricing, same scheme, except D4's store lacks 'FOMO' or, Fear of Missing Out, i.e., the shop lacks items and will rotate every item every 24 hours, some into the same slot, some down to the bottom, some up to the recommended. If you feel inclined to buy, just wait, you will never lose out and they never remove items from the shop. *Game that has soft-lock issues where not enough enemies spawn carrying Animus on occasion. *Waiting in queue indefinitely, soft-locking in queue, login soft-lock. *Item windows and comparison windows constantly flash on occasion (appear and disappear) with no apparent fix or cause. *Enemies die standing up and their model doesn't disappear. Haven't seen any T-posing, they just die with their idle animation active until you log out. Happens frequently in the Blood Harvest seasonal event. Made it to level 54 HC Necro, 70 SC Necro Tier4, Lack of dopamine in Helltides, World Loot is God Loot, Same Dungeon Spam. Completed exactly 5.5 Chapters of the season journey. Got bored looking at all the copy paste armor sets in the 'free' game. Didn't buy any Macrotransactions: People listen, I'm in Sociology, I do Statistics, I love Math & Logic, and these are *not* microtransactions. Micro = small Macro = large $5 USD or $7 CAD would be a microtransaction in this case. When the transaction is half or 2/3 or 3/4 the price of a video game, this is called a macrotransaction. This game has macrotransactions, there are no microtransactions in the store. It's an egregious business model and I have deleted all my characters and uninstalled. I can't recommend the game even though I sometimes enjoyed my time with it because there is only so much abuse consumers can and should take before looking to invest their hard earned disposable income elsewhere. These are just my subjective ramblings of this 40 year old. You decide if it's for you in the long run. Oh, and wait for a sale if you want to buy, the game is frequently on sale for -40% off. Enjoy @everyone!",0.915741503238677979

The gameplay loop is pretty fun, I can see why the series is popular. It's grindy in a fun mindless way, and it's a good movie/podcast game. But the focus on multiplayer and monetization hampers it. I just wanted to play this single player, and you can't as it's always online. It shouldn't be deck verified for that reason alone. It's not really a handlheld game to take on a flight, you have to have wifi. Even if you play solo. You can't pause the game for this reason either, so if you have to get up frequently or put games to sleep, this one isn't it for you. The game seems like it was once a good game, and then they in modern fashion stripped away all rewards and incentive for playing and charge for it. I got this for 40 dollars and beat the main story, with one character. I didn't do any of the post game and only did maybe a third of the side quest. You are bombarded with ads frequently, every time you unlock some tier, or to go to the map, there is an ad asking you to buy an overpriced cosmetic. The armor and stuff you unlock in game all looks the same, incentive's you to buy the predatory monetization cosmetics. I paid 41 for this game on sale. I truthfully think it's worth maybe 30 in it's current state , maybe less. I played at a leisurely pace and beat the main game and a 3rd of the side quest in 37 hours, solo.. If you're playing with friends, you might get more value out of it and beat it faster or replay it, but I play single player because as a 32 year old with a weird schedule, it's hard to find time to party up with friends, and most of my friends don't play this type of game, and I'm too much of an introvert to add strangers and play. After work I just want to chill, and this game almost has that chill vibe to it, but it's got to constantly shoe horn in ads and purchases, and that ruins it for me personally. I have no desire to play it again due to it's short comings. If i could give a neutral review, I would. But due to the negatives outweighing the positives, I am giving it a negative review. I've heard D1,2, and 3 are better. If they ever come to steam I'd give them a chance, but I don't think I'd give Diablo 5 a chance until it hits maybe 20 to 30 bucks if it's like this one. I don't like games as a service games, and this game is really trying to be that, disguising itself as an RPG, and that's just not for me personally.",0.883790910243988037

Malicious player can obtain a lot of sensitive personal information by use of common mod-menus for GTA Online. Currently Rockstar Games has not acknowledged or addressed this matter via any of their social media platforms, direct email or via a PR spokesperson. Worst thing is that you can fall victim of this without even knowing it. all a malicious modder need to know is your Social Club ID or In-Game Nickname. Rockstar has the means to combat this, but has failed to do so for many years. I will leave a youtube video about this topic here: https://youtu.be/UK1vLaHtgec and in the comment below this review from GTA V Speedrunner and rockstar fan 'DarkViperAU'. who has spoken with people who have access to these mod-menus/tools and brought it under attention to his following. Personal accounts with this issue: I myself have also fallen victim to this issue. This happend a couple weeks ago as per writing of this review. I was streaming GTA Online gameplay on twitch and via the stream a malicious person saw my socialclub name in the stream and started targeting me, joining my FRIENDS ONLY session whilest not being part of my friends list. masking his name by replacing it with racial profanity and harrasing me with gameplay exploits and other nasties. blowing me up, hunting me down in godmode and finally crashing my game. after that I switched my stream over to a single player game because I already have put one and two together. Thanks for reading. Any questions I will try to anwser. I love Rockstar Games and there games but this is bad beyond believes. EDIT: Here is a link to a guide I have writen a while ago on how to get a 'public solo session' to avoid modders and griefers messing with you. this is the best way to protect yourself currently within GTAO if you enjoy the game like I do and wish to remain playing it. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=902728436 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2708524915 Questions I get often under this guide; Q: Why do you keep playing a game you dislike? A: I do not dislike GTAV or GTAO, I want it to better. Q: Why do you keep playing a game you see as a security risk? A: I know how to weapon myself against the risk and I still enjoy playing GTAO so I do not quit. Q: Do you have more sources or proof besides the DarkViperAU youtube video? A: Yes, I will update this guide when I get more content on this topic, preferably from different sources. Including: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_fdhCXlPI0 https://youtu.be/C_fdhCXlPI0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dxa_28MTpw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NVxOX2Ea_4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqaHOHOtScA https://youtu.be/NfwhK4oGWgA https://youtu.be/UzfApHLP73w https://twitter.com/GypsytheScumbag/status/1552089044833779713 Q: Who cares? Online gaming will always be like this. A: I strongly disagree. while yes, a 100% cheater free online experience doesn't exist I know GTA Online could and should be better. Just look at what the FiveM Community has done, It runs on dedicated servers, has no widespread cheating issues and doesn't save any user data. Q: What am I supposed to do with the information you have given me? A: Whatever you want with it. I want to mainly inform you. the games networking is Peer2Peer and has next to no anti-cheat, creating a unfair and toxic online environment for normal players. with privacy risk, banning issues and so much more. I hope it help you to make an informed decision Edit: I will also start deleting comments that go completely off topic and or consist of personal attacks.

He also bought game for himself. I was so happy because I finally got opportunity to play something I wished for years. ( GTA ONLINE ) I played it so hard on ""GTA Online"" mode with my dad, where I spent around 300 hours of playtime in less than 2 months, maybe even a month. In time I said above, my character was 107 level, had all guns fully upgraded, had some bussiness, nice cars... etc Guess what ? I got banned for 30 days, because they said that I cheat...! I NEVER used any kind of cheats in any game I or my family paid with REAL MONEY, especially if it is a GIFT! My father spent around 25 Euros for this game in a way to suprise me + 25 Euros to be able to play with me on GTA ONLINE MODE! I was totally dissapointed, I wrote a ticket, and they responded me with their 'robot' message saying me that I used cheats and telling me that I have to wait for 30 days to be able to play again... but from ZERO! BUT HEY! ... I managed to 'survive' without playing GTA V for ENTiRE a MONTH! Then I finally started again, playing only Races in 'GTA Online' mode for couple of hours then quits. Next day, when I turned again 'GTA Online' mode I got a nice BLACK SCREEN with BIG WHITE TEXT saying that my account is BANNED PERMANENTLY from GTA Online! I WAS SHOCKED, again I wrote a ticked and explained the problem, but they just used their useless 'robot' by saying me that this is their final decision... So from that day, I SWORE TO MYSELF that I would NEVER buy any kind of ANYTHING from Rockstar Games ,and this will remain FOREVER. I know that you don't give a sh*t about me, which you already proved me with this useless 'robot' Rockstar Support, but with this 'approach' you are losing many your fellow fans and customers. NOW LETS TALK ABOUT A GAME ITSELF : 'Single Player' is simply fantastic and there is not anything more to say about it. 'GTA Online' mode was simply something best what GTA Series ever had until the end of 2016 year. After 2016, Rockstar became hungry for money by adding so many things which regulary doesn't belong to GTA Series anymore... like flying bikes, WW3 tanks, futuristic guns and other sh*t. This resulted in making this game DISAPPOINTEMENT, by losing all recognizable good sides of GTA Series ( where the cops and criminals was main thing in the game. ) By summarizing impressions... I MUST GIVE YOU A NEGATIVE REVIEW, because 2 reasons I said above. ( 1) Your approach to your fans and customers is dumb and useless, 2) You ruined this game with 'updates' from 2017 to this date. ) Customers, thanks for reading and have a nice day!",0.921487212181091309

Not only are they completely helpless with the cheater situation in the game but their attempts to stop them actually hit legit players as well. I've earned quite a good amount of in game cash during one of their double money weeks shortly before the last major DLC hit and Rockstar in an attempt to remove cheated/modded money removed 7 million (thats the equivalent of about 80 real life bucks) from my account. In-game money I had earned through their event. I've contacted the support multiple times only to receive responses that either claimed the money was cheated or threatened to ban me. After about 5 support tickets I gave up. Rockstar Games is scamming their own customers, and that's why I can't recommend being a customer of Rockstar Games anymore. If you already have the game and still play GTA Online I'd recommend doing the following: Go online and search for a cheater willing to give you modded money, proceed to get as much modded money as possible and spend as much of it as you can.

A year and a half ago, everything was more or less balanced, the prices were reasonable. After the Import/Export things were getting drastically different. Looked like this to me: ""Hey buddy, want to enjoy the content? Well, you should get our brand new garage only for 2M."" Then Gunrunning. Again, my overall feelings: ""Look at this cool update! The players will be able to get their bunkers only for 1.5M. Also, don't forget to upgrade your equipment for another 1M. Did we forget to mention that getting additional people working for you will only cost you half a million? By the way, you will time from time get raided and lose everything, unless you buy another cameras for 400K! All the raids will magically disappear! Want to modify your weapons in your Workshop? Well, too bad, you need a trailer for that, but don't worry, it's only 1 to 2 and a half millions. Do you want to train your shooting? There you go, only for 700K! Do you prefer white over black? The paint costs 105K, so... Did we mention that you can take a nap there? The key for that room costs 265K. Do you want a Gun Locker which you will probably never use? That will be 175K. You want some caddies? 85K or 120K if you want to have them larger. Don't forget to check out the new cars! Get yourself a car that shoots a couple of missiles only for 4-5M!"" How I felt about Smuggler's Run: Hello there! This update will be about planes. Want a hangar? 1 to 5M. Which style would you prefer? The one for 100k or the one for 320k? Want different lights? No problem - the more expensive style you chose the more expensive lights you'll get! Isn't that cool? Want some nice 'art' on the floor? Sure, we'll paint it for you, costs only up to 200k, just like your apartment you bought last year to do heists! Furniture? You mean another wall? That's another 280k for you. Again, want the keys to access your bed? 235k-375k. You want to customize your 500k glider? One word - WORKSHOP! And guess what this number, 1,150,000 means... Correct! It's the price!"" The prices of the content added were skyrocketing, if you wanted to truly enjoy the game, you had to either make money all day long if you wanted to be a fair dude that doesn't hack, which is by the way, another big problem with this game, or buy some cards that are horribly overpriced. At this point I didn't have time to play all day long, I didn't want to hack and I totally didn't want to spend twice the price of the game on some cards, so I stopped playing. Since then, I've been ignoring the game, not watching any videos and not paying attention to the updates. Sometimes, when I notice that there's an update, I come back for a couple of minutes and look how a vehicle with a couple of missiles costs over 4 millions. Now another heist update, you might think this: ""Oh, finally another heist, things are getting back to the state when you could buy a house for 200k and get full content."" The reality, however, looks like this: ""Hey, it's nice to see you back in the game, look at this brand new heist room only for 2 millions, the same idea, only way more expensive."" And as a person who doesn't have that much time to play anymore, I can't enjoy the content anymore. Another problem with this game are the hackers. I finally am thrown into a lobby after 10 minutes of loading, I see that I am immediately teleported to an airport from my house with a couple of other people and I am stuck doing some rather strange animations. I always report the guy when I find out who it is, but it doesn't seem to help.

I had decided to set myself goal of earning enough money through CEO Jobs and Biker Work to buy a Super Yacht. After a few days of grinding I logged on and found I had been banned. I checked my email and found an agressively vague non-specific email telling me I had violated Rockstars EULA and I had been banned from GTAOnline for one month. At first I was fairly okay with this, it was one month, and sometimes these things happen. Then I found out that I had my character stats, profile, money and assets wiped out. So I left a ticket on Rockstar social club querying this and attemping to appeal the ban and got back a generic reply that I had violated the EULA and the ban is final. I have spent the last month sending in tickets, asking different questions trying to at the very least pinpoint what my violation of the terms of service was. I have yet to recieve anything except identical replies, all giving me the exact same vague information that I had violated the EULA and had been banned and that all bans were final. I tried calling up Rockstar technical support (which I only found the phone number for my country on Reddit - thanks to who ever posted that), and the person on the phone read me the EXACT same reply I got by email and then proceeded to hang up. At the very least Rockstar has some horrible customer service. At worst, they are deliberately obstructing and willfully ignoring the compaints of paying customers. No automated ban system is flawless, and prior to this I would have agreed that people claiming false bans are just whining cheaters. But now I believe that there is at least a minority of banned players who have been banned for no valid reason, have had hours upon hours of gameplay wiped and have no recourse to appeal the bans. There are victory stories from before Rockstar updated their ban policy mid-2016 when people had been able to appeal the bans due to false-positives, and this at least shows that the automated ban system is flawed. Let me be clear: I couldn't even find out what I did to earn the ban, let alone be given the chance to refute it. Overall: So: if you want this game for singleplayer, go for it. It's good. Story isn't as tight as GTAIV but the gameplay has improved greatly. But if you want to buy GTAV for Online only, think twice; because you may end up having hundreds of invested hours wiped out for no apparent reason, and have no way to even appeal or find out why.

I've been playing the game nonstop for a past week, making money for a bunker and new cars and in the middle of a game, I just got falsely banned for a month for no reason at all and my character and progress INSTANTLY reset. It's a shame because this is a blast to play with friends, but Rockstar just can't seem to manage shit with their own game. They don't try to improve the experience, pushing out a bunch of events that no one seems to care about, releasing new content that require days of grinding and instead forcing everyone to buy their absurd shark cards, which people still apparently get banned for.

It really deserves a neutral review, maybe a 6/10. I enjoyed certain parts of the game, and I've put more than enough hours into it to get my money's worth. At the very least, the soundtrack is great. However, RimWorld suffers from way too many missed opportunities and shortcomings to give a positive review. Colonist Development doesn't offer real choice First off, I could not bring myself to care about my colonists, because player influence over long term pawn development is extremely limited. I think this can be broken down in to 3 main areas. Traits: The system with the biggest effect on pawn behavior is Traits. Unfortunately, traits can never change, and they're decided entirely at character development. Even in places where it seems obvious that you would be able to influence pawn traits, you can't. For example, one possible background is Glitterworld Surgeon, and the description suggests that this character has done a lot of plastic surgery. Why can't I have that pawn fix another pawn with the Ugly trait? Sprites: The biggest way pawns change is through injury or body part replacement. But this only manifests through numbers since pawn sprites are static. Get your jaw blown off? Doesn't matter, same sprite. Get a bionic eye replacement? Nope, same sprite, same eyes. As a means of conveying important information to the player, the UI and overall graphic design of this game SUCKS. Skills: Leveling skills isn’t fun or engaging due to 3 problems. 1) The pawn has to be at least ""interested"" in the skill for it to be worth the effort to level. Interest is random, and decided entirely at pawn generation. 2) Their skills will always regress down to level 10, so the game is always dragging your pawns down to the same baseline. 3), There's no choice or input, it just happens whenever they use that skill. For a game about managing people and influencing their fortunes, RimWorld does a terrible job of acknowledging the player's lasting influences on the characters. The RNG nature of events and storytelling shatters immersion in multiple ways. Most of the engaging (i.e. not fast forwarding) gameplay comes from random events generated by the “storyteller”, an A.I. director. Most of these events fall into the category of ""minor inconvenience"", so they're not even things that a player can meaningfully react to. E.g. : Someone got the flu. Good thing health care is completely automated and requires no input to resolve. The only time these issues are critical is when game systems interact in unintuitive and frustrating ways, like your doctor deciding that eating and sleeping is more important than treating illnesses and people end up dying, unless you tediously micromanage the situation (more on this later). The flipside of this is that once your colony accrues a bit of wealth or exceeds a pawn count, it ramps up the difficulty and gives you events that far outclass your ability to handle them, e.g. a robot ship coming to kill you or two dozen man eating muffaloes rampaging through your base. In order to beat these events, you either have to A: accept the RNG and let some pawns die, B: save scum, or C: Construct your base in an extremely “gamey” and immersion breaking way to trick the enemy AI into getting itself killed. The map is pointlessly large, and only serves to make winning harder So there's a neat feature where every major landmark in the world gets a name and a unique climate. This is a legitimately cool feature, but badly misplaced. The problem is that once you choose your starting location, you could cut 75% of the map away and it wouldn't matter. The game doesn't give you any real reason to experience the other 75% of the map. World events always spawn close to your settlement, and you can trade locally for everything you need. Packing up and rebuilding somewhere else is a huge, tedious ordeal, and isn't worth it. The reason for the huge map (as far as I can tell) is that the game’s win condition, escaping on a downed spaceship, is always located far away from your home base. To be fair, that journey can be fun, as finding clever ways to manage settler's moods, always wondering when the next ambush is, and building minimalist bases along the way gives a solid sense of progress, and is generally engaging. However, the game deliberately lets you circumvent that by building your own space ship anywhere, which requires an absurd amount of resources, which increases your wealth, which leads to absurdly hard events, as discussed above. Colonist AI is dumb and micromanagement is tedious. All of these complaints would be forgiven if the actual gameplay was fun and engaging, but it’s not. The solution to most of the game’s shortcomings is either A: install a mod to fix the problem or B: tediously micromanage the problem away. Some examples: Hauling: Pawns are awful at logistics. Every pawn has the efficiency of hearses in Cities: Skylines, which is NOT a compliment. If anything needs to be moved quickly, the player must manually select a pawn, and order them to haul that specific item. Oh, and some pawns have traits that prevent you from doing that. So if that pawn goes hunting, they will usually carry their kill back. But if anything interrupts that action, you can’t force them to go back and bring their kill to the base. As I've said before, sometimes game systems interact in frustrating, unintuitive ways. Crafting: When crafting items that take several ingredients, if you don’t construct your base in a specific way to minimize travel time, pawns will waste 75% of their time just transporting ingredients in the least efficient way possible. In other games, solving logistics problems can be fun and engaging. I love Factorio and Cities: Skylines but in those games, I feel like I'm solving an interesting puzzle. In Rimworld, I'm babysitting idiots that have no personality. Decison Making: Pawns will very often neglect life or death situations to do something like eat or sleep. After a big raid, you might have some injuries. But rather than rescue a dying friend 2 feet from them, pawns might decide that they have to walk halfway across the map to eat, leaving their friend to die. Uncontrollable Mood Modifiers: Hungry pawns will walk across the map to get a meal, but not the extra 3 tiles to eat at a table. This can’t even be manually controlled, so you’re forced to accept the penalty to mood. There are a lot of examples of mood modifiers being outside of player control, this is just the most obvious one I've found. What makes this even more stupid is that there's literally a random modifier that will give a mood bonus or penalty, this is just extra. Cooking: They’ve even added features since beta that only serve to give the player more to micromanage. As of beta 18, colonists get food poisoning if meals are cooked in a dirty kitchen. Yay realism! But apparently no one considered the gameplay ramifications. There is no way to assign individual cleaning locations so players wind up constantly micromanaging pawns to clean the kitchen. Boo tedium. Mods A lot of fans will tell you that mods fix a lot of these problems. That's only partially true. Things like trait interaction and pawn development don't have mods that I'm currently aware of. Regardless, if a game's quality can be judged after other people put work into it, then Unreal Engine would be the best game of all time. TL;DR While Rimworld is fun at times, it's generally too tedious, and too limiting in player choice to get a recommendation from me.",0.754638433456420898

On one hand, it wants to be a lightly comical ""story generator,"" as it says on the menu screen. ""Twists and turns! Watch your people be eaten by geese and fall in love!"" On the other, it wants to have relatively tight gameplay about logistics. ""If your planting zones are too big you've done messed up your optimization."" These two demands kind of conflict with each other. After about 50 hours of play, I never really encountered the content freedom that made my runs feel unique, like a generated story. There aren't 100 bizarre plot twists that occur, like weird obelisks that mesmerize you or mysterious wanderers. On the other hand, the ""plot"" that does happen -- getting sick or a prisoner making a break for it -- sometimes seem silly for silly's sake, and after enough time becomes subsumed to pretty regular gameplay. Often these happen as ""tick"" events, as taming an animal takes X tries at Y percent of success to reach Z quantity -- not exactly a story generator. Worse is that the time-scale is pretty unforgiving. There is an element of ""Haha can you believe my best colonist died because a cougar bit off his hand!?!"" but then the hours and hours of progression is in danger. The game seems to not want you to reload, to let things play out, but for me the game is paced a little too slowly and can go wrong so fast, that it just seems a little off. Reloading isn't fun, but then again, neither is accidentally hitting someone with a grenade after 15 hours of hard work, setting you back hours and hours. Another negative for me is that it's a bit too much of a sandbox for starting conditions. Ostensibly, you're running a base of crashlanded strangers on a border planet. But you always crash land with the same materials, you get to pick exactly where you land, you can re-roll all your characters (for hours if you want, if you're psycho like me). I tend to like beating ""official"" challenges, and the freedom here (LOTS of opportunity for meta play at the beginning, i.e. rerolling, restarting) was not a plus for me, and seemed to contradict the story-generator sense. (I eventually installed the ""Prepare Carefully"" mod. If you can re-roll ad nauseum, why not just spare yourself the time? This mod lets you create a character within self-imposed limits. (i.e. attributes worth 1,500 points total)) Overall, as my first foray into this kind of game, it was accessible and engrossing for a while. But 50 hours in, I'm starting to grow a bit critical and frustrated with the game. That being said, I've picked this game up off and on for a while now, so it's obviously hit me from an unexpected angle. Bottom line, if you're trying to be careful with the games you spend time with (so little life, too many games), I'd consider being wary with it.",0.749876677989959717

But I wanted to leave this review for others like me who are not sure if the game is for them and leave some points to consider. What I enjoyed about Rimworld was the freedom it gives you in creating your colony and the stories you can create, and how every playthrough is different. The quests and interactions with other settlements also help creating an continually interesting expirience. I also enjoyed the ideology DLC, which I think gives it even more depth and customization options. But then there's everything that annoyed me. First thing was the atrocious UI. Not just the design and the menu hierarchy, but also how and where information is displayed. This, I think, is also true for the rest of the game. This is a shame, because information is such a central part of such games. And there's a lot of necessary information you have to figure out on your own or look up in the wiki, because the tutorial doesn't tell you, from clothes and armor to temperature, roofs, mental breaks and more. It was very frustrating to figure out that roof collapses are a thing by one of my colonists dying. And the last big thing that I think is important to consider before buying is the micromanagement of your colonists. Not just the colony, but every individual person. If you're into that, that's good for you, but this was a bit too much for my taste. I don't want to tell them to remove the roof before removing all walls of a building or that one rock is ok to mine and the other not, or else they die. Sometimes they are smart enough, like putting on better clothes when available, but other times they are stupid and go eat insect jelly in the middle of an infestation when on a food binge. And yes, there are mods to adress a great many of issues and change the game to your will. But if the game is just a canvas I have to fill with mods, then it should cost half than what it currently does. The game is still being worked on, and maybe things will change, in which case I'll adapt this review. But until then, I can not recommend to buy this at full price. As a similar game, I can recommend Prison Architect, which costs slightly less and offers a more refined expirience, imo.",0.738418698310852051

I have over 100 hours in it and will probably log some more, but most of the time I can't really tell if I'm even having fun. It sells itself as a story generator, but none of the stories are all that interesting. For starters, I love games like Gnomoria and Dwarf Fortress, it's exactly my type of thing. I like managing things and creating a setting in which an interesting story can take place. But RimWorld is not that. So RimWorld has a so-called ""Story teller AI"", which is a fancy term for event script. This AI determines when events like raids, disease, breakdowns, drones, etc. happen. There are 3 AI by default, only 2 of them worth mentioning. One is just an RNG, it does things regardless of the gamestate. The other tries to be ""interesting"" and make events happen based on what your colony is like. The issue with the ""interesting"" AI is that it's very predictable. You have a lot of food stocked up, so your freezer will fail in some way and it will rot. You have a lot of components stocked up, so expect every device to repeatedly break down. It's more or less ""if the player is doing well in this regard, make them not do well"". This leads to you just gaming the system and living on the edge of ruin at all times to avoid these events. If this were a story, it would be a terrible fanfic where the writer's OC is just ruthlessly abused for no reason. Hence, I use the random AI. Now there are many events in RimWorld, but few really give you many options, which is its main failing as a story generator. If there is a raid, you must fight them. If one of your colonists goes on a rampage, your options are to attack them or let them attack you. If there is radiation, you stay inside. If there is a cold snap, you hunt for food. If there is a physic drone, you just endure it. The game is asking you a question, and both of you know what the answer is. If you do not know the answer, you fail. This barely creates a story, simply a list of events that happened independently of each other. Now to the next thing; fights are utterly boring and unbalanced. Most bullets will spray wildly off to the side of their target, even if the gun is of an excellent quality and the shooter is of a high level. Firefights are just bullets wizzing around randomly, and sometimes a bullet hitting something is the end of the fight. Your heavily armoured sniper can be instantly killed by a bandit with an old pistol, meanwhile the sniper shot and missed 6 times. The reverse can also happen, of course, but the point is that the fights are quite unsatisfying, they take ages yet are over in a second. This brings me to my final point; animals. It feels like a majority of the events I ever see are manhunting animals, or animals who otherwise decide to attack my colonists despite better options. Many times the game will spawn a pack of small manhunting animals, and I have to decide there if I risk fighting them or just accept that I can't leave my walls for a few days. Even 2 manhunting rats can get someone killed due to the lack of gun accuracy. If you have turrets, you must also turn these off so they don't wildly spray at the animals and get targeted, as even a single manhunting monkey can cause a turret to explode. This isn't fun and doesn't make for an interesting story, I mean maybe it's funny the first time, but the game wears this joke out very fast. Case in point; my last colony. 3 people, one non-violent, so two gunners. A pistol and a rifle. Literally nothing happened for 90% of the colony except some cargo pods. Then a manhunting monkey. Okay, we got 3 lucky shots and downed it. Then 2 manhunting rabbits, we killed one and the other one bit a finger off the rifle guy, okay great but whatever, we killed both rabbits. At this point I'm really wanting another colonist so I can do more, a quest arrives to rescue someone so I decide I'll do it. My base is well defended, with the only way in going through a nest of insects, so I feel safe sending my two gunners and leaving my pacifist home to tend to the base. One day into the journey, my caravan is attacked by manhunting chinchillas. I try to run, but they are too fast, so I turn to fight. My pistol guy shoots 4 rounds, all miss. My rifle guy shoots 2 rounds, all miss. The chinchillas then slaughter them. Back at base, 2 manhunting rats have spawned and saw my only colonist entering a door. The two rats break down the wooden door and kill him. A man in black arrives and kills the rats. He is incapable of dumb labour so at this point the game is over. A panther decides to hunt him for sport, he had no chance to run, shot and missed with 3 rounds and died. That's more or less this game, the only stories you'll really generate are dumb ones such as the above. I have seen all stages of the game and it seemingly never evolves past these petty events, and it really explains why a majority of the stories people have of this game are either butchering humans or having some wacky animal wipe them out.",0.724269628524780273

There are a lot of things you can do, and a great modding community, but the game has a sort of false depth. It's like they have provided us a lot of tools, and its fun to use them while you are still figuring out as you wonder the extent of possibilities. But soon as you figure out the mechanics, you realize that its actually very simple. And while understanding the mechanics and triggers are essential part of arcade games, it's counterintuitive for simulations. It makes it very difficult to maintain the suspension of disbelief and the game quickly loses its allure(at least for me). I understand that simple mechanics are part of this game's design philosophy and as a result the game holds very well mechanically. However, I feel that if you wanna create a simple game, keep it at a simple price. Some notes for players that are coming here after seeing hyped up videos from youtube: * The notes on paintings are randomly generated, and while they do have your character's name the context rarely make sense unless you really force yourself to make sense of it. * The pawns have relationships in the sense that they either really like or hate each other and begin fights when they have too much mood debuff. They don't actually 'talk' to each other. Just randomly generated logs (""talked about politics/dogs"") if they are in the vicinity. * The pawns have traits like neurotic or pyro or beautiful. They affect either their skills or social standing. They don't have a personality as such. And traits are just a representation of what work they are good at (shooting, cooking), some of which they are better at learning. * You can do a Warcrime playthrough. But the only effect in game you will notice is that your pawns and other colonists will have a mood debuff. It just another Wednesday in the Wild West. * And the other colonies are pretty much non-existent. They don't really interact with each other or have an influence on the world. They are just.. filler. If the price was half of what it is, I'd highly recommend it. But this price seems to be for what the game appears to be and not what it actually is. If you have great imagination or need some inspiration for worldbuilding or not worried about the price, go for it. (Really, its good). Otherwise depending on what you are looking for, there might be other games that are better. Hell during sale you can get entire Fallout 4 for cheaper. Subnautica if you want exploration-survival, Frostpunk if you want colony, Surviving Mars if you love Tech Trees. I also need to add that, there is this growing popularity of a new metric of measurement where people see the 'hours of entertainment a game provides'. And honestly that's not a good metric. Spending 3 hrs playing Rimworld is not the same as spending 3 hrs watching Dune/Oppenheimer or swimming in a rented pool or watching TV. And on the same note 40 hours playing a beautiful linear story is worth much more than 100 spent in something like counter strike. People please stop encouraging this metric. I know we need to 'support the devs' but this is not the way. There is a growing trend of newer indie games being priced like AA games. When the best thing about indie games apart from their innovation was their reasonable cost.",0.713465869426727295

Certainly there are some good things here, I have over 40 hours logged because the game's world and mechanics are intriguing; the graphics have a certain charm, they are more than adequate for a game like this, and it is set in an interesting and well thought out sci-fi world. Unfortunately I kept finding myself underwhelmed by the content and options that the game actually presented me with. I should state that I have played and enjoyed Dwarf Fortress, and I am a big fan of permadeath and Roguelikes in general - I have ascended in and even contributed to Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup, which by the way is a free and awesome game so go download it now if you haven't played it :) The problem for me with RimWorld is that while there is a really interested structure of a game here, that structure has not been fleshed out with enough meat. For something that has been in development for nearly 3 years this is quite worrying, especially with the apparent pace of updates released by the developer. I really do hope to eventually be able to change my review, what needs to change for that to happen is that the mechanics need to feel rounded out in the core game without relying on mods. Certainly there are mods available that fix many of my concerns with the current gameplay, but £23 is rather a lot for a title that then requires mods to turn it into something resembling a complete experience. I'll conclude this review by listing some specific things that I think badly need addressing; going through this list it becomes apparent just how nearly every single mechanic in the game feels majorly lacking. Warning, some spoilers ahead, though they are very minor. 1. Some bits of furniture can be ""uninstalled"" and moved to a different location, but it seems completely arbitrary which furniture this can apply to. It doesn't apply to workbenches, so if you want to move one a single square to the right you have to completely deconstruct it and rebuild it, *wasting* resources. There is a mod that makes them all movable. This mod simply switches some flags in the xml files, no more, so it would be incredibly easy for the devs to enable this (like a 10 minute job) and there doesn't seem to be any logical reason why they don't. 2. Many of the workbenches have only a single option for what you can build. Would be nice to have a bit more variation, when the build queue for each bench technically alllows building many things of different types. 3. Research is too expensive and makes much too big leaps. Would be nice to see a proper research tree with smaller increments of unlocking different builds, rather than typically unlocking an entire bench with all the things it can build. Weirdly there is one research option that unlocks a new type of seed to grow, but *all* the other seeds start unlocked. The research just overall seems bizarre. I can right now research (among not many other things) ""carpetmaking"" or ""ship antimatter reactor"" ... the latter only takes twice as much research as the former ... this just seems like not the right decision to be making. 4. Not enough options for surgery and implants. I can harvest someone's heart or kidney but not their limbs or their eyes. I can implant bionic legs, but I can't repair a broken spine. I can't construct these bionic implants myself. It seems like half the options there. Again there is a mod that provides a whole extra set of technologies to enable all this but it just feels the vanilla tech is unfinished. 5. Variation of enemies. Particular the mechanoids, there are only two types. Surely mechanoids could be even more varied than humans or critters? 6. GUI. There are all kinds of odd bugs and inconsistencies and awkwardness in the GUI. Sure it's a massive improvement on DF but It *really* needs some love. There are also some basically usability things missing, for instance being able to compare the stats of two items or two characters side by side, or see a grid overview of the skills of all my colonists. When setting work priorities there is a grid where you have to hover over each cell to see the value of that specific skill, it's really awkward. 7. Combat. The sometimes continual raids that the ""storyteller"" throws at you get really tedious to defend, you have to micromanage every unit, which is really jarring next to the normal gameplay which is the antithesis of micromanagement. Combat should be set up by giving colonists rallying points or patrol areas, so during a raid they will all go to those locations. Take away direct control of the units, and make the raids a bit easier to compensate. This would much better fit the gameplay of a ""colony builder"" game and be a lot more fun. Currently the best way to defend against raids is to abuse gameplay mechanics and pathing logic to direct the enemies into killboxes, which to me feels like cheating. Things need tweaking A LOT to make these firefights enjoyable. Also if you have trained any pets then they will get immediately slaughtered, probably by friendly fire. You can’t really mix melee and ranged combat at all because everyone (even those with high shooting skill) aims so badly they will just shoot your own melee dudes and pets instead of the enemy. 8. Balance. The game is very hard, and switching to easier difficulties doesn't seem to change much. The ""storyteller AI"" basically decides when it wants you to die and there doesn't seem much that can be done about it. Apparently this is the point of the game. I would find these stories much more interesting if my colony had a chance to develop a bit further before inevitably getting decimated by overwhelming forces. It doesn't help that it's extremely slow and difficult to recruit new colonists, so usually losing even one or two (which is very likely to happen in any raid) is a serious detriment to any progress. Maybe I'm missing the point, but I was just not finding it enjoyable. 9. Size of map, travelling to other sectors. The default map really isn't all that big, so resources are strictly finite. When you start the game you pick a spot on a *huge* world map but then you can't visit anywhere else on that map (even though factions from elsewhere can visit *you*). Well ... I think those are all my biggest gripes, I could probably think of more, but this demonstrates the scale of the problem. I could see past one or two of these flaws because there is a really interesting game underneath struggling to get out, but with this many barriers to me enjoying it I just keep not wanting to carry on with my game. I'm not sure how long it will take the devs to fix all of this, if they ever do, but we could be waiting another 3 years.",0.704495429992675781

The DLC's all-together cost over $80 CAD - which is obscene! That's more than the price of a triple-A game - and just for DLC's. This is, of course, an entirely personal opinion and I would probably change it if anything for Rimworld ever went on sale, but honestly I regret buying the base game now.

I enjoy playing it, but on its own, it's also a rather simple game, with plenty of limitations, and imperfections. The main quality the game has going on for it are the thousands of mods freely available in the workshop. I myself used to enjoy playing with anywhere from 200 to 500 mods at a time, creating my own lists, tailoring my game experience to my tastes. Very few games out there allow you to do this. It's great. Then the DLCs arrived. Sure, they're optional, and with Royalty it was still possible to find almost any mod out there that would work even if you didn't own the DLC. Ideology made things a little bit worse, now many mods relied on the new mechanics to work. Still, these DLCs were expensive relative to the base game price, and added little original content of their own, but eventually I bought them just so that I could play the game with my mods as I used to do before. Que Biotech. Biotech rips off a few mods' ideas, packages them for about 75% of the base game price, and completely breaks almost all mods out there that I used to enjoy. I refuse to have to pay almost as much as the base game I already bought to be able to play as I used to do previously. Unfortunately, most mods won't be updated or mantained for those who do not own all the DLCs. Legacy versions slowly disappear and large modlists are now simply broken and unplayable. It's understandable, but this has effectively killed my ability to play and enjoy the game permanently until I shell out the money for Biotech - after I already paid the base game and the two previous DLCs. To top it all of, the man behind the game is an out of touch egotist who has started to change the price of the game every other quarter, supposedly based on the $ strenght and inflation rate. The latest DLC was already too expensive, now it's insultingly so, and it feels like being made fun of. I'm very disappointed. I miss my game. Shame on you.",0.690777897834777832

I love the brutality of it, the story-telling aspect, I love to build my colony into a vast organ-stealing empire and raid and plunder my neighbors to my hearts content. I bought Rimworld originally on console, started a decent colony, had all nine colonists eaten alive by bunnies, and was immediately hooked. However, when I saw the difference between console and PC I was disappointed. I felt like I was limited severely with the no access to the newest DLCs and Mods. I bought the full package on PC and got started with Biotech, Ideology, Royalty, mods and started crazy playthroughs. HOWEVER, after starting many new colonies and downloading hundreds of mods with new flaura and fauna, game mechanics, etc, I started to notice that the quality of mods was equivalent to or better than the quality of content in the DLCs. Then I learned that a majority of the animals in Rimworld were originally made in a player submitted mod that was integrated into the full game by the devs after coming into agreement with the mod creator(s). At that point I started thinking about other mods in comparison to DLCs, particularly with biotech and child development, and I realized that a lot of the content in this game comes from the dev team looking to the modding community. Babies and children have been modded into this game for YEARS, but Biotech was only released fairly recently at a price of $30. Im not saying that the devs adding content from mods to the main game is a bad thing, I think its a great tool to keep the game healthy and fresh and introduce new ideas. However, I also think the problem here is that it feels like the community cares more about the quality of content in the game than the dev team. The devs let the community come up with cool new stuff and then they use that as ""inspiration"" to add new features in a paid $30 DLC. I think this game is great, I love creating colonies of sadistic organ-harvesting nudist cannibals, but I dont like spending money on content that has been in the modding community for years. I dont like the idea that in a year or two from now there might be a DLC that adds vehicle creation because that is one of the most popular mods available today. I think that this inspires a lack of effort from the devs to create new content or quality of life features which affects ALL platforms.

Owned this game from Alpha 1 (start of 2014). While I appreciate the fact the game falls into an under-served niche, is developed by a small studio, has decent music, etc. There are a number of problems with the game/""studio"" (aka Tynan, primarily a one man show). - The game has been in ""development"" for ~4 years now, and if you picked it up today, and tried to compare it to other price comparable games, it falls short, it always has. And that's part of what bugs me. - Every time there's an update, there are a number of really minor, easy to implement features, that are touted as huge deals. Look at the latest, ""Beta 18"", Tynan spends a chunk of his trailer/hype video talking about how the game now assigns randomly generated names to regions on the map, as though this is a *major* feature. Frequently things are done to the game, to add more ""story"", and opportunities for people to ""role play"" and ""use their imagination"" (This is the focal point of several major version releases). That's fine and all, but ""role playing"" with your imagination is a value the player is introducing, the developer spends $0 on that, and shouldn't be touting that as a major game-play feature, you can role play anything, literally. - The dev has repeatedly taken long hiatus' from the game (to the point his own forums were inundated several times with ""ok, so is development effectively finished?"" threads), because he needed a 3 or 6 month vacation, and he's a one man show. For the amount of money Rimworld has taken in, it really hasn't pumped out that much (I'm sure Tynan has done *REALLY* well, and he's entitled to, but the other games that take in this sort of coin, return much more to the fans). - The reality is, every time there is a major update, it comes after a significant wait (from every 1-2 months a few years back, to 5-6 between versions now, and growing). Updates are typically filled with what are technically minor achievements, without significantly touching the core gameplay ""oh, I added a new 'mental break' for your pawns, same mechanic, but this action targets ""X"" instead of ""Y""). - The modding community is great, but it should bug people that a mod written by one or two people can introduce more content in a month or two, than what the developer does in over a year. If the developer was doing major rewrites to the core of the game, the actual framework, I'd understand, but that's not what's going on here. Numerous mods make far more drastic changes to the core of the game, than the games updates, do so on a regular basis, in a fraction of the time. - It's like RW development hit a brick wall several years ago, any new features are ""too hard"" and out of the technical reach of the developer; The bag of tricks is exhausted, and the developer is too proud of his personal project to bring in more talent. The only thing that gets added is a sprinkle of the same old in a slightly different flavor. - The full released content/game base grew by a <14MB in the past year, over two major versions (including all assets, art, music, etc.), honestly, what does that tell you? - Last, but not least, the toxic community. This isn't unique to RW, but there are a slew of ""fanboys"" who can't take this sort of criticism, and will shout down any negative reviews, name call, etc. It's like people are worried that we'll hurt Tynan's feelings, and he'll stop all work (as he has in the past). It's childish, and really off-putting. Tl;DR: It's an ok game, and it's not terrible by any means. But with that said, it's a terrible value for the price and I can't recommend it. Don't expect any major development beyond what you see, because it'll be years out, if it ever happens. The closest mirror to this is Prison Architect, it's built on the same engine, has the same gfx/gfx designer, is half the age of RW, the technical and game play complexity dwarfs RW,, far more content, and is currently 1/4 the price (admittedly on sale right now, and has been repeatedly, while RW has *never* gone on sale once).",0.667846858501434326

On the one hand, I have sunk over 900 hours into it by now, and will probably play hundreds, if not thousands more. Rimworld is simply sublime at sucking you into an evolving, dynamic story experience where your colony lives or dies based on a mixture of random chance and player skill. Unfortunately, it's also let down by some massive, glaring issues that have never been fixed in years of development, requiring community mods and scenario edits to fix. Perhaps the biggest issue present in Rimworld is that it is objectively unfair, and tries hard to screw you over in arbitrary ways. Insect infestations in the mid-lategame are a major example. Do you like 50 hives spawning from three tiles worth of exposed mountain, with 40 of said hives magically appearing behind your walls and turrets? What about sappers, who magically have the ability to break down walls made of solid plasteel in under ten seconds, using nothing but a club? How about solar flares, which shut down all your electronics, even those buried under a whole mountain, with no way to predict or block them? Events like these also show how simultaneously primitive yet fundamentally omniscient the enemy A.I is. If you know how to exploit it, raids of any magnitude and power are effortless, but this requires an obnoxiously counter-intuitive playstyle that breaks your immersion completely. Mods are what make Rimworld great. They fix the deep, lingering issues the developer has failed to address, and open up a vast world of possibilities for the player to explore. They can also break the game at random, wreck your saves, and consign a ten year colony to oblivion with no warning or way to recover it.",0.644661784172058105

This game...is *THAT* good. It's the thing that kept me coming back for hundreds of hours. 2) The modding community. It is vast, like the prairies and deep like the ocean. If it weren't for the modding community making up for many of the shortfalls of the vanilla game I'd have never put in all the hundreds of hours that I did. There are some seriously dedicated modelers who upkeep certain truck models (such as the Freightliner FLBB - my all time favorite). 3) It's easy to lose yourself in the sim - you can pick it up for 15min at a time or play it for hours on end.4) Head Tracking and VR supported brings game this to a whole new level (I'd argue buying VR just for this game is a monumental waste of money however).And now, for the hard part. While I absolutely loved this game... What's not to like: 1) The modding community. It is vast, like the prairies and deep like the ocean. I often feel like SCS has relied on the benevolence of the community that so loves this game to make up for the many shortcomings this game has from cosmetics, to truck models, desperately needed negine/transmission variations, freight variation, playable maps (THANK YOU PROMODS) to OWNABLE TRAILER TYPES FFS. The list literally goes on and on an on. I feel like SCS just makes maps, collects money, makes more maps, collects money, releases a new model every once in a while, but never any functional improvements. ALWAYS it is the modding community making the game better than the base game. and it has been this way since ETS2, and has carried over into ATS. 2) Little has changed in the years since it was created. Jobs are still pickup freight from Point A and drop off at Point B. There are no LTL (less than load) deliveries, or delivering to multiple customers out of one cargo haul. No contract jobs (haul x amount of freight fot a customer within a certain period of time), no such thing as freight lanes you can reliably plan on. How, in all these years, do we not have this yet??? Freight variety is also SEVERELY lacking. This isn't such a big deal in the Reefer/Dry Van because you don't see it, but on the flatbeds I get tired of hauling the same 4 or 5 loads. 3) You can't sleep in your sleeper cab in parking lots that aren't designated as specific resting areas. In the real world, drivers often sleep at their shippers/receivers if truck stops or rest areas are full. Again, this is an easy thing to implement, yet here we are, years into development without this option. I can't even pull into a hotel parking lot and take a snooze for a couple hours - it has to be a FULL sleep cycle. This became such a PITA that I turned off the sleep requirement because it was so poorly executed. 4) Fleet management/building a trucking empire is quite honestly a joke. Once you've learned the game and how to get a solid start, you can quickly amass a fortune in the hundreds of millions of dollars with no way to spend it. Stop lights? Pfft, who cares if you run them. Weigh stations? I just roll right on by because there are zero tangible consequences. Money becomes monopoly money at that point and the only way to make things a challenge again is - you guessed it - an unofficial mod from the community that drastically changes the money you earn for jobs. This is all a symptom of a larger issue in the game - ATS/ETS2 is purely a ***driving*** simulator and not a ***trucking/business*** simulator. Just imagine the possibilities here folks, and then realize what we're missing and feel that deep regret. 5) Let me take a moment to talk about the severe, and utter lack, of ownable trailers. Yes, we get a new trailer once in a while but it's bad. It's really, really bad how slow the implementation of this has been to date. We need someone at SCS devoted to this singular task of making new ownable trailers and freight to go with it. Otherwise this game gets boring fast. And i mean FAST. 6) The traffic AI in the game is T*E*R*R*I*B*L*E* in so many ways. From coming to complete stops before entering an empty freeway to stopping in the middle of the roads for no reason at all, complete inabilities to merge with other traffic, etc, etc. It's laughable. 7) Weather. It does not exist in this game (unless of course, you use one of the community mods!). While their *is* rain, it has no functional purpose other than to obscure your driving vision - it does not affect road physics or driving dynamics at all. A real lost opportunity. 8) Truck maintenance/upkeep. Not really a thing here. There's no fear of blowing an engine if you accidentally downshift into the wrong gear. No fear of overheating and blowing a block from overworking an engine. You can cook a trans from running it too hard up hill. no blown tires for driving off road. No maintenance schedule even to follow and/or consequences for not doing an in-frame rebuild within a certain mileage - absolutely nothing. Look at a game like IL-2 Sturmovik that has real consequences if you push your machinery too hard for too long. These trucks have all these fancy dials and gauges that do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Yet another lost opportunity. Let me be clear - I have over 850 hours in ATS and over 350 in ETS2, and I continue to play them when I get bored of everything else in my library. The likes and dislikes listed above apply to both. And while I have loved this game tremendously, genuine development of the game has basically never been a priority and fallen upon the community of dedicated modders to keep the game fresh and interesting for someone like me. This game *could* truly be an amazing game worth any price tag. As it stands right now, I'd only buy it when it's on sale 75% off or more. Without the mods, I'd maybe have a hundred hours in the games. Combined.",0.768123388290405273

The ""run your own trucking business"" sim part of ETS2 is simplistic and barebones. You never see any of your other trucks driving the roads no matter how much you watch for them. You assign drivers you hire to trucks you buy/outfit, and then tell them where they are based. The jobs they pick up are phantom ones from a separate pool you don't have access to, and beyond telling them what cab they drive and where to start from, there's little to no control or interaction with them and as a result they feel as artificial as they are. Once you've spent a few dozen hours picking up trailers and driving from point A to B ad-infinitum, you start looking for something else to enrich the game.. which is where the DLC are *supposed* to come in. Unfortunately all they add is 1) More driving locations, and 2) More cab/trailer parts and decoration to change the look (and sometimes the performance) of your cab. The base gameplay never really changes at all, no matter how much money you shovel at the game. The large loads addon (?) can give you some slightly different logistical hurdles in terms of jobs/loads, but they are fairly rare and never as lucrative as the long-range time-limited jobs you can get on the market. SCS has had 8+ years to add more diverse gameplay systems to ETS2 - we know they've had tons of suggestions on their forums, but only modders generally pick up on it and try to implement them. SCS is happy to milk this title to death without really improving the gameplay, or working on a worthy successor that does have enhanced gameplay. Would I recommend the game after ~500 hours? Only if you get just the base game, and on steep discount when it is on sale. Don't buy any of the DLC except the Heavy Cargo pack, or a country add-on if you simply *must* have that country (i.e. you live there, etc). They just aren't worth it for some changed scenery. To the Developers: The day you realize the gameplay/business sim implementations in ETS2 are far too simplistic for today's gamer and start work on a new and improved version (i.e. ETS3) is the day I start taking an active interest in ETS again. It's stagnated, stale, and passe 8+ years later.",0.693297088146209717

Nice day/night changes, a peaceful feel to it, a chance to listen to MP3s in a fairly stress-free game, comfortable controls. It took me a while to get it set up, but I was soon chugging up hills at 15 mph. I think my main disappointment was to do with expectations. The blurb says: ""dozens of cities to explore"". I didn't expect 1-to-1 fidelity, but to me, explore means at least they would feel like cities, and be vaguely recognisable. Much as I'd have loved it to be like driving through Google Street View, I had already scaled back my expectations. I assumed maybe cities would only have a third of the roads, something like that. I wasn't prepared for reaching Cardiff, a city I know well, and discovering that it seemed to be two roads and a depot. Likewise with Swansea. Ouch. I'd persuaded my girlfriend that we might be able to drive from our hometown across Wales, then on to Europe, and eventually down the coast of Italy, perhaps finding the town where some of our family live. Wrong. The vast majority of places in each country are missing. A few cities will exists as just a couple of roads, nothing like what you'd expect from Saints Row/GTA/Sleeping Dogs. Don't get me wrong, that would be great but I understand why things have been scaled down - I just think it's deceptive not to make that clear from the sales blurb. If that had stated that there were 40 urban areas out of the many thousands, and that cities were scaled down 1,000 times, and that places with populations of below a million weren't included, I'd have at least had an idea of how far the game is from reality. For example, the UK alone has 69 cities (and many thousands of towns and villages) but ETS2 only has 18, each of which is a few roads. Cities mainly act as just blobs on a map, connecting points. A grand tour of Europe this is not - it's a patchwork quilt edged by invisible walls (well, you can see them, big Xs and chevrons floating in the air to stop you heading towards landmarks or B-roads or anything that isn't a motorway). The map of Italy seemed to cut off at the very edge - so technically Italy is included, but only as a few clumps of road in a teeny area. It seems disingenuous. Most European countries don't seem to be in the game. This is a disappointment only because of the misleading advertising. It seems you can listen to radio stations in game but I never got that to work, no matter how many URLs I added to a text document nested far down my hard drive hierarchy. No error messages - good luck if you aren't IT literate. Finally, I think I'd have got a bit more pleasure from it if I could have also had the option of driving around in a car rather than a truck. It's weird that the game simulates many things; as a company owner you probably have a car, but there is no option to go anywhere in it. I'd have thought a free drive mode would have been a nice addition for people like me, who don't want a racing game, just something more sedate, but the chance to explore the small part of Europe that has been included at a bit more of a zippy pace. Still, that's a suggestion, not a criticism. The main feeling I had was one of disappointment at the scale of the game. It may be hundreds of miles wide, but the detail is only inches deep, a surface impression that didn't really satisfy me. I can see why others might be happy with it. Maybe a more accurate blurb would have helped, rather than trying to sell the Earth. --- I can't comment on my own review's comments thread due to some error (thanks Steam), so here's my response to the comment by HaddockA, who said ""You're seriously crazy to even think that such a game in 2016 could even exist... That's like having GTA V multiplied by a factor of 1,000.... you're seriously weird. ."" My reply: ""I probably am crazy but that's a separate issue. Having never played one of these games, but having used the free Google Street view which lets you do something similar, I don't see why it was crazy to imagine the game would map 33% of the roads, rather than 0.01% (or whatever the figure is). After all, it says ""cities to explore"". But you get there and there is nothing to explore. Just a few roads, one supermarket with an empty car park, and a background view you can't reach. If the blurb included what % of Europe's roads were included in the game then I'd be a fool to expect otherwise, but they don't include that information, thereby inviting inflated expectations.""",0.682043015956878662

To begin with, calling this game a sim of any kind of a real stretch. Driving is an aspect of a trucker's life, yes, but just as much of it is stopping to take your breaks, interacting with other truckers, and unloading once you've reached your place of destination. None of which you'll find in this game. Which I guess might be fine, if the driving itself were exceptional - it's not. At first I drove carefully and took care not to damage anything because I wanted to take the game seriously, not yet conscious of the fact that the game itself doesn't take anything seriously. You could be speeding like a maniac at 90 km/h down places with a 50 limit and the most that will happen to you is that you get a fine. Which are irrelevant, considering they're not only cheap but have no real impact on your career. You could be found breaking the speed limit three times in the same run, and that's just jolly. You're never at any risk of losing your license and ending your career. The economy in general seems broken, with cash being super easy to generate. Another issue is the dead world. The police in this game might as well not exist, because you can break the law right in front of them and there's no reaction. More jarringly, if you're found breaking the law by the game, a police car will spawn behind you and then magically disappear right after it blares for a few seconds. The cars (not trucks) you see on the road are all more or less the same and in all my hours of play so far I've never seen any noteworthy vehicle or interesting behavior from them. I've never been driving at night down a highway to have some sports car with blaring music drive past me at an ungodly speed only to find it crashed with police around the site some 200 km later after I've caught up with it. Nor have I ever spotted animals as a part of the fauna. ""Cities"" are basically a couple of scattered buildings that are more or less indistinct from one another. You will never feel that excitement of seeing a great capital in the distance, knowing you've reached your destination. Or you've arrived at the port? There's no bustle, no vehicles, no people - nothing is happening. There aren't even any seasons! And going by some reviews for the DLC the game is missing main trucking roads in some countries like Romania and is barren of architecture associated with the location in cases, like with Italy. It just feels lazy. This isn't some niche title played by a few hundred people and made by a team consisting of one dude sitting in an apartment somewhere in a tiny town in eastern Russia (their team, according to Google, is 170). Then maybe we could talk about making an exception. But the reviews for the game alone at the time that I'm writing this number about 300k, so we can assume there are MILLIONS of purchases. Given all the overpriced DLC, that's some real profit, baby. But all this is offering is some arcade driving, a few basic roads and locations... and that's about it. I legitimately thought driving around the roads in GTA V was way more interesting and rewarding, and if that game offered a map of a similar size with a trucking mini-game built-in it would absolutely shit all over this. I don't know, maybe I'm being overly harsh, but it's insane to me how much is missing from the map. Even if we left aside other things that should be in the game (like historical landmarks in their respective cities), there's no excuse as to why the roads aren't in a better shape. Especially not then, since it appears that's the one thing the game is focused on (by process of elimination, since it sucks at everything else). So, yeah, this is a nice thing to play if you're just listening to a podcast and want to keep busy doing a rather braindead activity. If you buy it on sale, you'll probably get your money's worth in terms of hours played and then some. But if you're buying this looking for a proper trucking experience, it's not there. And if you're just looking to travel around Europe and go down different little roads and see the landscapes and landmarks - that's not there either (with some minor exceptions). You won't get all of Europe with your purchase - not even all the DLCs will get you there at the time of writing this review. And hell, there's no point in talking about little roads in the middle of nowhere, since they haven't been capable of adding main roads used primarily for trucking in all the countries featured. The putrid stench of how Paradox does business is all over this game. The developers found a niche market they could operate in without competition and see no issue doing the bare minimum while releasing overpriced DLCs. I actually saw one of the positive reviews saying that the devs are still ""supporting"" this game in 2020, and that was lauded as a a great thing. Really, they're milking it for everything it's got.",0.664142608642578125

With dozens of cities to explore, your endurance, skill and speed will all be pushed to their limits.",SCS Software,Euro Truck Simulator 2,SCS Software,"In short: Decent truck simulation, but only very shallow game. This game could be so much more, too bad the developers settled with the game as it is, because it is already hugely successful. This game really badly needs some competition. The good: - The trucks are nicely detailed, driving model is ok. There is fair amount of them, as developers keep adding new ones (although at a very slow pace, hardly 1 truck a year). - The map is great, it's huge and getting bigger and more detailed over time with paid DLCs. - Fair amount of trailers ^ That's basicaly all, these 3 aspects are enough to make this a ""top"" trucking game of today, because like I said there is zero competition. Now the bad: - the game itself is extremelly shallow: in single player, there are no goals, no late game, ABSOLUTELY nothing to do. Except for driving around ofc, you get ingame money for that but there is very little to spend them on. You can start and ""expand"" a company by buying garages and drivers, but again there is no real reason for you to do that. No rewards, no in game competition, no leader boards, no goals at all, nothing. There are simply no challenges, but there easily could be. - the simulation part is not very deep. The trucks brake way too easily even with 40+tons loads. You can flip a trailer in a turn but thats it, forget about having to worry about stuff like your trailer sliding to the side in a turn, that doesnt happen in this game. The trailer weight doesnt affect controls of the truck like in reality at all. Also, forget about advanced stuff like interactive cabin and truck systems, the cabins are nice but you can't switch or do anything in them apart from turning the wheel. - The damage model is a complete joke. There is ZERO visual damage to the truck, and even the virtual damage is a complete arcade joke. I kind of understand why we can't have an detailed visual crash model, but not even stuff like flat tires, In 2018?? Even ancient games from the 90ties had at least textures of scratches on the 3d model, or something. And ofc, there is not even slight hint of truck maintenance, in this ""truck simulator"". - There is no difference between hitting a concete column and a small bush. Traffic signs, small gate rails, bushes, almost everything is solid concrete in this ""simulator"" game. -The map is huge and fairly detailed, but there is no police, no events (constructions, traffic jams etc) or anything dynamic whatsoever. -this game used to be difficult at times, but recently they added quick save and auto save, absolutely removing any challenges left to this game. -This game is marketed at steam as ""massively multiplayer"", this is a huge lie. THIS GAME HAS NO MULTIPLAYER AT ALL! There is an alpha version multiplayer mod, which is unofficial, unsuported by the developer, made by someone in his spare time, and it shows. Just an example: we had to wait 1/4 of a year for them to update the multiplayer version of ATS. And you CANNOT complain about this to anyone, because, remmember, ""this a free alpha unsuported mod!""... The multiplayer itself cannot be more primitive: everyone is on one big map, no rules, no leaderboards, no goals, zero traffic, trolls and hackers everywhere, and no customer support ofc. And yet, SCS DARES to market this as multiplayer game?! This is outrageous to me, because the people making the mod are not getting ANY kind of support from SCS, yet their multiplayer mod undoubtedly helps SCS sell this game. So if you are planning to buy this game to play online, think again. This is game made for SP. To sum it up, this is a decent truck driving game, but calling it a simulation is a bit of a strech. Only buy it if you enjoy just driving trucks around, for no reason. I personally consider this game highly overrated, mostly due to lack of competition. I rate this game 6/10.",0.646581947803497314

There seems to be a massive gap in quality in major areas of the game. The attention to detail on trucks and their interiors is absolutely fantastic, probably 3D scanned down to the millimetre. Meanwhile, every city is literally 3 intersections with a cardboard cutout of a famous building (so no actual city-driving to be found here), there's about 10 different types of non-truck car on the road, the only mix-ups in gameplay you find are randomly closed exits and 1 lane being closed for construction. It all feels like the focus of the game was put into adding a million tiny DLCs for new areas and truck customisation. Meanwhile every single quick-job is the exact same thing; pull out of this lot, drive on a highway, park it in a different lot. Why aren't there some unique objectives, like ""take this construction equipment to this point on the map where there's construction"" or ""try and navigate this awkward trailer along narrow, sloped city streets""?

I don't feel the sense of accomplishment with this game that I would expect. The game works, and it presents a calm environment to enjoy doing what you normally wouldn't. I'd compare it to playing an idle game that you also can enjoy for its own reasons. So while the games mechanics as such are solid, there's a few issues with the game: - The distances on the map are shortened massively, and as a consequence time itself is accelerated accordingly. While for the end result itself this might not be an issue, even bigger drives across Europe don't take too long. Crossing a country like France passes in a heartbeat. I would have liked the distances to be shorter on the map, but more ""realistic"" (still shrunk, but not to this degree). I'd feel happier if the base game contained the Benelux Countries and expanded from there. - The detail of the road network is quite poor. Country-specific detail isn't there at all (e.g. highway exits), and the roads feel very gemeric. Also, the cities could be bigger, giving a bigger challenge navigating the truck (see the point above). The only exciting thing I encountered was driving backwards with a trailer before concluding a mission. After a handful of drives, this factor wore off though, leaving me behind with no real motivation. TL;DR: This game is good if you're looking for a relaxing game. If you need some purpose or challenge (like I do), look for something else. Microsoft Flight Simulator X might be something similar to consider then as it adds more challenge navigating and operating your ""vehicle"".",0.60645139217376709

The cheating has completely ruined this game. You can join a random server and inspect the steam profiles of random players on that server, and 3/4 of them have some form of ban, or brag about cheating on their account. Rust has been one of my all time favorite games, but over the last few years while Facepunch has been adding more and more amazing content, the player base has become worse and worse. Now-a-days you're more likely to run into a person that will scream profanities, slurs, or just be a blatant cheater. They don't even try to hide it anymore... If FP would address the cheating, I would be back in a heartbeat, but until then... STAY AWAY.

Spawn and run down the beach at night. Notice a silhouette of a player up the hill from me, (as I was down hill and out of ear shot, there was NO WAY they could have seen or heard me) and when they look in my direction they instantly double headshot me in the moonless pitch black night - multiple game bans on their account.

DISCLAIMER: This review is old, and as such does not reflect the game in its current state. I have been notified that apparently substantial changes have been made to the game. These changes might have fixed a lot of the issues that were inherent ot Rust, especially community based ones. But I myself am unable to confirm this as University and studies are taking up more and more of my time and as such i am unable to actually recheck any of my above statements. WANT A PREVIEW WATCH STIMPEE AND MEMEIO ON YT DISCLAIMER 2:for those unsure what this review is. The game contrasted with Vallheim shows the issue of a lack of PVE elements where the E is dangerous. That is just a fact. Want a co-op game do that. Rust is a PVP game with survival elements. DO NOT CONFUSE RUST WITH A SURVIVAL GAME. RUST IS A PVP GAME WITH BASE BUILDING AND SURVIVAL ELEMENTS. THIS REVIEW IS FROM SOMEONE WHO BOUGHT THE GAME EXPECTING A SURVIVAL GAME. PROS: -Intense survival experience, you are a mortal in a dangerous world - Initially cold, hunger and thirst are real threats. - The graphics can be very pretty, if you can run them. - Sounds are nice, gun shots ring out and pierce the still air. - Building is interesting and fun. - exploration is interesting and the blueprint system is pretty fun. CONS: - The community tends to be absolute garbage *Expanded at the bottom* - Servers tend to be immediatly taken over by massive constuctions, and sometimes clans immediatly dominate. - Resources become scarce pretty damn quickly - Animals run up sheer cliffs and can be quite glitchy - No costomizability *this is very minor* - KOS; COD style. -Optimization, my decent rig constantly overheats if I don't put my fans into hyperdrive; manually. NOW TO EXPLAIN: The community is simply cancer. If you are neaked and a geared trooper sees you, you can almost bet that he is going to shoot you for no reason. The excuse is; this is PVP, and that you ar a potential danger, or even ""Just like in real life"" Well here is the issue, KOS is not very real life, BUT the game is silent, it is dead when you move around. The only thing to break the silence is gunshots, some screeming from what is usually a poor helpless naked that has just barely managed to get his 2.5k wood to start his shack. Even when he makes his shack, instead of negotiating forming an alliance, this player is eliminated, his base raided for little to no resources and as such he has to start all over and the raider gets the thrill of raiding an offline 2 by 2 shack. This is all due to a KOS mentality that is so far from survival mentality that it is in reality COD mentality. The game runs like this: 1) Spawn, get materials build a small base 2) get blueprints and start gettign ready to wreck some anus 3) establish dominance in your area 4) Once dominance is established with your little posse build a massive unraidable castle 5) dominate the area and consume all resources, killing anyone you see for the fun of it, because you are now bored. 6) Make four excuses : ""Git Gud"" , ""Become like us"" , ""Everyone is a threat, therefore I can KOS because I feel like it"" , ""Man salty nakeds"" I once managed to get a small group going, immediatly a small but well armed clan emerged from their base and began hunting nakeds, just because. We had just managed to make a bow for one of us, when they emerged from the trees and just sprayed into us, killing all 5, and screaming through their mics that we suck and to ""git Gud"". This behaviour has slowly but surely been spreading throughout the entire community because it is the best way to play. Kill everyone, steal their resources, build yourself. It's also pointless. It makes the game a ghost town. Not but one year ago the servers were full of new players. Now the servers I usually play on barely peak over 1/2 the population, most of those being either clans or KOS' ers. It is sad to see such a great game go to waste because of the community, the only break from this is RP servers and PVE servers. RP servers maintain that PVP aspect, but give it a nice twist where KOS is rerely an option as each side has quite a lot to loose and tensions get higher than ever, whereas with KOS its usually just a naked dropping dead every so often. Sometimes clans will clash and then everything looks great. But those occurences are rare. The community needs to change if the game is going to ever survive, and in fact, thrive. I would suggest implementing a system like unturned has. You cannot hide weapons in your quickbar, either you have a tool to quick draw or a weapon, and then everyone can see how well armed you are, as well as add some strategic depth to the game. Also make nature more intense, make the PVE aspect even more challanging, its apparently post nuclear time, some strange shit ought to be walking around. It would add a nice threat to well geared players and well give nakeds a nicer start as they are suddenly not the primary target for shits and giggles. There also needs to be benefits to living a peaceful life, and benefits to living a violent one, and each needs its downsides. Right now violence is the only solution, pitifully so. Your chances of going out and finding a place to survive peacefully is nigh impossible (This is vital as you have no means to fight back effectively unless you are a god at PVP, you need time and space to build up otherwise clans are mandatory or just a willingness to grind and be online 24/7). Especially when these massive bases make their rise. The only person rading such a base is another person with a similar base, and even then they will probably fail, and require a clan. KOS is simply not beneficial in any way, and it is in fact detrimental. It simply takes away any real purpose in playing solo, and in fact makes random encounters and random party forming... impossible. KOS should remain firmly in the realm of FPS shooters, COD and Battlefield. Not survival games where you shoot at non threats because you have hit endgame and need someone to plink at. The game needs to change, and minor changes are needed. But as it stands I would not recommend the game. An amazing idea ruined by a terribly toxic community. Maybe ill come back to it next year. --> NOTE: No I havent don't have time. EDIT: Basically this review is beyond old, i put the damn disclaimer in. Additionally now that it has been years since I have played but I have managed to watch some playthroughs of random people, stimpee is one example go sub to the man, the issue of the game and many like it seems to be that the game lacks a real PVE aspect where the enviorment is any threat at all. Sure you get helicopters and now player placed turrets and guards, but thats really a null threat in the end as you get better, and generally they can be avoided. But there were ideas early on to make the world truly threatening and even terrifying. This makes all raides a double gambit. Imagine if firing guns causes some kind of mechanical construct to come to the area eventually. Or mutated animated stone or something. The sky is the limit. But it would mean that all PVP actions are bringing to the game extra content. In a way this means that areas ""dominated"" by players will become high tier areas. There is huge threat there, and there is also huge payoff there with additional end game content and items and challanges. This then frees up areas around the region for people to build up and deters nakeds from entering this area. As said before a lack of ability to hide your items is also very important. It means that when you are raiding, you are raiding. When you are mining, you are mining. When you are armed... you are armed and everyone knows it. The game doesnt need to be a toxic hellscape full of prepuberty squekers who just want to take out their adhd on something. But maybe thats exactly what the game was meant to be.",0.862816691398620605

The devs have purposfully made it so you cannot enjoy this game as a new player and in my opinion taken away the essence of rust and made it just a longer term battle royale game for the following reasons 1. Impossible as a solo player unless you play on a dead server or a solo only server (which just go play a farming sim in that case) you will most likely never see or touch a gun as the large groups of expierienced players will kill you every 2-3 steps and due to them nerfing the bow and spear (the only obtainable weps for you) it is highly unlikely you will kill any of them 2. The game is so old and toxic that finding a solid group requires either slaving for 100+hours or geting extreemly lucky because most established groups kill on sight 3 Its not what made rust popular anymore in the since that no one talks over vaciinity mic. Which means people will not communicate with you besides the ""haha get owned bitch"" that occures after 4 of them shoot you to death as you try to eek together enough wood for a spear 4. Because no one uses the mic anymore the community aspect of the game has deteriorated. People used to help newbies and and least say a few things before the shots ring out.. the only thing you should expect to hear from other players is a gunshot sound followed by your screen going black And to those trolls who are undoubtly going to say ""mad cause your just bad"" I played the full expierience was in a succesfull clan for ahwile and solo'd to some degree of success for the last year or so. My point is not that the games to difficult its that its unfair and if you happen to be a FPS god you will have much more fun on other games. But if your thinking about buying this game without ever playing it b4 i strongly suggest you save your wallet. Ive got 800+hours in this game and wish i could return it now",0.858365237712860107

Then if you have the patience you will learn to grind and 'farm' monuments enjoying some pve for high tier loot and hopefully fighting off any counters. You may even learn to control some of the spray on the various guns but inevitabely unless you are WILLING TO CHEAT to get ahead you will end up never becoming more than a mediocre player. Why you ask? Well after burying nearly 2k hrs into the game I met some well known top tier players through a friend of mine, and after some time and trust I was advised that in order to level the playing field, I download scripts costing £15. These scripts have a key bind for specific weapons and the player only engages them when needed. These top level players are successfully scripting on a daily basis on the larger servers, destroying kids with AK assault rifles, stream sniping and genuinely being proud of themselves. BLURGH After the 2k hours I have put into this game which I loved and becoming what I would call a half decent player, this new information has completely killed this game for me. I never cheated on duke nukem back in the day and I sure as sh!t won't be starting now. Why am I quitting the game now? Rust is a survival game, if you die you lose your gear - lose your hours. As someone that wont cheat out of principle and the way it would make me feel, I cant bring myself to play a game where my 2k hours and hard practice can be levelled flat by the purchase of a fricking script. I will not lose one more hour on a playing field so distorted with dire consequences to me facing unfair fights. Save your money and your time. FACEPUNCH FIX IT please.

Here comes my review on the game in it's current state: Rust is an amazing game, one of, if not the best survival games on Steam right now. But the thing that drives everyone, literally fucking everyone away from it, is it's community. The community in Rust is quite possible the most toxic and unfair group of people you will ever lay your eyes upon and you might truly think they all deserve to die, they might. On modded servers where you don't have to farm for an hour before you're able to even think of getting a base, still, it's nigh impossible to play without a group of 4 people or more because you will be demolished by every squeaker who gets a waterpipe regardless of skill. Now on vanilla servers....where the gather rate is NORMAL....there comes to issue of a broken keyboard/monitor etc. you will be out alone for a VERY long time and the second you run into one person with better things than you, you have to start over ALL. OVER. AGAIN. It's very repetitive unless you have a group of your closest friends to play with you so you don't get destroyed. On the decent side, again, Rust is a very amazing game without the community, with great building systems, radtowns to find loot, and an amazing world to explore. But once more, stay away from this game until the community grows up and finally finishes 3rd grade, or you have a group of friends to enjoy the game with you.",0.854583323001861572

Rust used to be great, but it's just gotten worse and worse. Positives: The game looks really good. The devs update every month. Fun interactions with other players if they don't shoot you in the head. Creative base-building. Great PvP-system. Negatives: First off is the community, which is probably the worst one out there. The devs encourage zergs, so there is no point in playing solo, because everyone is toxic, childish and an upright crackhead. Official servers are the most popular, but they are filled with hackers, so no need to play there. Community servers are better, but people leave them after a couple of days because of griefing, and the current ""blueprint"" and component system being a punishment, not a reward. The main problem I have with the devs is that once they fix something, they find something else to intentionally fuck up. They made the component system better, but then introduced the ability to let other players build on your base. Great. They started making the current system better, then introduced an upkeep system. This basically means you have to divorce your wife, quit your job and move back to your mother's basement in order to play the game, because you have to be on everyday maintaining your base. When I started playing you had a pure blueprint system, which was more or less flawless. It was completely random what blueprints you could get. The only grind was farming resources. Simple, progressive, fun. Now when you start you'll farm resources to build your base. Then you farm resources to upkeep your base. Then you farm components so you can create items. Then you farm scrap so you can research whatever you find and craft it aga-- scratch that, you have to prioritize having the scrap go towards something called a workbench, which is expensive as balls. Once you've made the three different workbenches, you can start researching items. Then you farm these amazing blueprints you find in the world, which includes game changing items like a rug, a table and a chair. When you finally get a hazmat suit, you'll explore the launchsite. If you're lucky you won't face a 15 man zerg there, and get to the top. There you'll find these amazing elite crates which contains super items like the chainlink fence, gears and an SMG body. I. CALL. WORTH. Would be logical to expect a solid base after investing 10-20 hours over a weekend, right? No problem. Just remember to log on every day for the next month to farm more resources so your base doesn't despawn because of a ridiculous upkeep system. I could go on and on about the problems this game currently has, and trust me, there's plenty. So should you buy it? Nope. This game recently came out of early access, which means the devs are very happy with the state and directon of the game. Just know this, paying 30£ for the game goes directly to the head dev researching the state of spoiled pickles over the course of a year. Amazing.

Do whatever it takes to last another night.",Facepunch Studios,Rust,Facepunch Studios,"So I know what you're thinking. Another negative game review for a game that is getting great press. How could this person be so ignorant of the majesty that is RUST? However, there is a specific reason I'm giving this game thumbs down. It will not go anywhere, it will take your 20 bucks unless you get it on sale, and say thank you for your money, and it will leave you feeling in some way molested after the experience of playing it for a few days. Let me first start off by saying the game is fairly well put together as far as it’s landscape. The game map has very few clipping issues, or pit falls that will leave you stuck, and unable to retrieve your gear if you can get back to your gear before it disappears. The higher end guns and ammunitions work fairly well together, and the graphics are pretty good up to this point in the games development, so I can’t give it bad marks in these regards. With that said I must commence with the game breaking negatives this game has to offer. After a few romps around different servers it has become clear that the game engine of this game is so full of security holes it could be used as a cheese grater. What could have been an awesome game has been reduced down to a slew of game cracking trolls that spend their time finding exploits to the game that allow them to fly, summon in anything they want, and know exactly were you are on the map at all times so that they can kill you and laugh. After reading up on the web about this wonderful game breaking experience, I was sad to see that the game engine used for the game is the cause of this slew of security problems. In short, the game designers would have to completely port this game over to another game engine just to fix the issue of hackers galore. Meaning they would have to start from scratch. This game is in Alpha stage, and I understand that the company still can say that it’s in Alpha stage and it will still have problems. The issue is the game will stay in Alpha stage. The majority of people that want/wanted to play this game have come and gone, the player base has been destroyed. For a game that is to be a multi player game it will not have the multi player community after it’s all said and done. Please, I beg of anyone thinking about playing this game to just say no. If you want to end up either dropping the game after a few days of play, or turning into a Troll, please stay clear of RUST. In truth please stay clear of any game that says ALPHA in its description. At least with a BETA game you can say it’s past the majority of its development issues. I don’t care what age, race, or gender you are. It’s your responsibility as the player to put a stop to game companies wanting to get the juice out of a lemon before it’s ripe. And in the case of RUST I will chalk this game up as a learning experience. Edited 7/3/2014 OK, so I have to give the makers of this game major Brownie Points. they're actualy going to restart the game over on another game engine. Seriously this takes big man tenders to actualy accept the fact your product isn't going to work, and put forth the effort to fix it. Hats off to you guys working on this game, but still until the new release commes out, and it proves to be a lot more stable I'm going to keep this review up on your site. maybe some day I'll switch it over to a recommended.",0.840771079063415527

I loved Persona 4 Golden when I played that in 2020, but I felt torn when I played this game in late 2022. It’s not a case of the gameplay formula growing stale or me growing out of it, I played Persona 3 Portable for the first time ever in January 2023 when it had its Steam port released and I loved that too. It’s Persona 5’s writing and runtime that ruin it for me. First, Persona 5’s character writing ranges from alright to forgettable. None of it is necessarily bad, but most of it isn’t quite on par with P3 or P4, save a select few characters. This is just a minor issue though, as my real problems lie with the overall story. My second issue is with the writing for the game’s overarching story. The story in P3 and P4 aren’t incredibly groundbreaking, but they have their moments, and mesh well with the style of those games and their other systems. P5 definitely has the style, and even has a few interesting bits, but its story is just bad. It refuses to commit to anything, be it character deaths or even a conclusion to the game’s events, and it’s genuinely exhausting. Even this wouldn’t be too bad if the game had the 50 to 70 hour playtime range that 3 and 4 do, but this one clocks in closer to 120 hours. A lot of this time is consumed with menial filler, too. Animations that play too often or take too much time, too much empty dialogue that refuses to progress the story or develop the characters, the frequent traversing of Mementos (a required P3/P4 style dungeon with 82 floors and almost no actual substance), etc. With some cutting, Atlus could have made this game shorter, denser and honestly much better. I don’t hate this game. It has a fantastic soundtrack, and it has a lot of style. The gameplay itself is a huge improvement over P3 and P4. Unfortunately, its flaws weigh it down enough to the point where it’s hard to say I really like it, either. Overall, it left me with a foul aftertaste. Not because it’s irredeemably bad, but because it was so close to being good. I tried to go in with low expectations, but I still found myself annoyed at the game for these omnipresent flaws.",0.667855799198150635

What is good? The presentation is brilliant. The visuals - beautiful! Striking! Delicious! The soundtrack is delightful and fun (if lacking in variety considering the game's scope) The setting is pretty cool. It's a cute version of Tokyo, full of life and activity. What else is unique? Three things. First, the dungeons in this game take place inside villains' heads. You fight within their unconscious. A great idea! But most of the time this consists of fighting pumpkins and endless variations of sexy women with wings. The villains also each represent one of the seven deadly sins. As you can imagine, these different ideas - the unconscious, funny little odd creatures, and bad concepts from medieval Catholicism - don't match up. Second, you play up against a turn limit. Each day is divided between day and evening and you can take one main action in each. This could mean that you are tasked with making deliberate choices about which skills and relationships to prioritise. I started playing like this. But over time you realise that most of the time you do the activity with the person when they invite you, otherwise you do the skill that has a bonus right now. You can't push relationships forward much outside of this. There's not much to be gained from either optimisation (not needed) or specialisation (you can't. You're pretty much the same regardless of playthrough). Third, you fight with personas, which are a bit like Pokemon, and can merge them, sacrificing one in the process. The Persona menu is unwieldy, and collecting Personas doesn't work well, because you can only have a limited number at a time. And if you move too quickly through the menu then a character shouts at you, which got annoying. I got 30 hours in, up to the third dungeon (of 7 I believe) and I was tired of the core of the game. Everything else about it is *fine*. The characters are fine, the story is fine, the gameplay is fine, the dungeons are fine. But you can't spread mediocrity over tens of hours and create an engaging experience. The aesthetics can only take it so far. There are clearly lots of people for whom ""RPG of average quality story & gameplay with brilliant presentation spread over 100+ hours"" is appealing. There is a lot of game for your money. If that's your cup of tea you will like this! I feel like if I were younger, had less alternative choice, and hadn't read the equivalent of generic YA stuff many times this could appeal.

I gave it a shot. While I love the style of Persona 5, the game feels like a miserable slog to me. Just under ten hours in, I defeated the first major boss and closed the first small story arc. I like the characters and the story is interesting. Despite that, I found myself blasting through dialogue out of sheer impatience. I know time is a theme of the game and mundane daily routines between action is another sort-of theme, but it made me care less about the good things in the game when I was spending 3-5 minutes clicking through dialogue that adds nothing to the story and just boils down to ""Who do you want to get a +1 relationship point with?"" or ""Which stat do you want to go up by 0.1?"" Nearly everything I've done so far has had one path to follow. If I even try to explore the world outside of that path a little bit, I get stopped by invisible walls and some dumb dialogue from my character like ""I shouldn't go there yet"" though my character usually has no reason to know they shouldn't go there. He's new in town and somehow already knows where everything important and unimportant is? Yet I still need to listen to 20 minutes of exposition, explanations, and tutorials between every decision point. Speaking of which, every decision point I've seen so far is a choice between: a. Hell yes! b. Well… OK c. Yes, but say something dickish for no reason There's just so much fluff. Nothing I do feels like it matters. I don't discover anything on my own. I'm dragged to every solution for every problem. The entire game feels like it's on a rail. Maybe later on I can lean in one direction or another and it might matter, but I have no reason to believe that based on my first 10 hours. I value my time too much to keep dumping it into this. I'd rather just watch an anime. It'll take much less time to get to the point and probably tell a more interesting story. So that's what I'm doing now.

I didn't hate the story or characters, but I feel like there isn't enough meaningful gameplay or interactions. I liked quite a few of the character bondings but it's very bloated and you often spend a lot of filler time which makes a lot of the interactions lose a sense of importance. I wasn't able to drag myself to finish the game but the gameplay is too simple and repetitive for too long; even if I was slowly introduced to new mechanics I felt like so little of it mattered. The core gameplay mechanics themselves function fine, even if it is a bit simplified. But the day to day activities, bonding, and fusion mechanics are very tedious (example: needing to bring corresponding Arcana for bonding) and filled with trial and error (mostly fusions) to the point of wanting me to unleash my persona; P3 style. I feel if they just removed 80% of the filler days I'd enjoy a much more condensed experience. I also hate having to prioritize bonds between characters I am more fond of vs characters that have actual useful benefits as a game mechanic. I put off playing P5 for over half a decade because I felt like the game wouldn't fit me; turns out I was right. Although I know a lot of people enjoy the game.

One grinding annoyance throughout the playthrough is P5's seeming total lack of respect towards the player's memory, repeating every single piece of information 10 or 15 times just gets absurd across 80+ hours.

Yes, the dungeons are hand crafted set pieces now instead of P4G's corridor marathon, but they're still the same repetitive game-play loop of ambushing shadows and opening doors. The trivial puzzles that are occasionally sprinkled in hardly breakup the monotony. And in any case, P4G's corridors make a return in Mementos, only now longer and more monotonous than before. Yes, the combat and interfaces look flashier but the game is even more shy about presenting any kind of challenge than P4G. Yes, your new gang has some interesting moments but there are much less special events with them than in P4G, and there are so many monotonous dialogues about the rotten adults in charge that would surprise even the Kids Next Door. It doesn't help that most boss fights consist of equally monotonous monologues about how rotten they are. There's more problematic elements I could gripe on & on about: Yusuke's creepiness (""Pose nude for me or I'm calling the cops""), Haru coming in too late in the plot, Makoto & Futaba dominating the party too much, the fortune teller that predicts what your friends want to hear in exchange for money, etc. etc. Finally, P5R adds a third semester & while the main story of this extra leg is fairly compelling, there is almost nothing new to do here. It's ""Go to the Gym or Jazz Club until the timer runs out"" semester, because none of the other daily activities are worth doing at this point. Overall, it just feels like I spent 150 hours on an experience that would have been better if it lasted 40 hours.

Somewhat.Would I recommend it? No. Not when Persona 4 Golden exists. I had been excited to play P5R ever since I immersed myself in P4G. My biggest dissatisfaction with P4G was that the dungeons & combat were not enjoyable, but this was remedied by the fact that the main story intrigued me and I enjoyed the character-writing. Was it the best? No, but there were many moments where the characters felt believable. I enjoyed their interactions not just with you, but each other, thus making the game’s finale bittersweet. The big thing I kept hearing from fans of P5R was that it effectively 'fixed' the dungeon-crawling. I found that to not be the case. In fact, the dungeons and combat somehow became worse, and it all comes down to one factor: Quantity, not quality. P4G's dull, randomly-generated dungeons were tiring, but, the hand-crafted dungeons of P5R are twice as long in length per Palace. This, with the added factor of fights becoming extraordinarily repetitive because of the dungeon-size and lack of variation between encounters, caused me to need frequent breaks just to endure. This is especially frustrating when you learn after the first dozen hours of P5R that P4G's randomly-generated dungeons do exist in addition to the palaces, known as Mementos, a location that must be completed as part of the main story’s true ending. If the combat and dungeons aren't an issue for you, that means the main story and characters are still going to have that strong P4G charm, right? In my opinion, no. Had this been the case, I might have been forgiving like I was towards P4G, but this is where P5R became a deal-breaker for me as I reached the 60th hour: It was excessive. P4G's mystery-plot was enticing to me, because I couldn't really guess who the main villain was going to be until the big reveal. It was a fun shock, and it made the confrontation feel all the more satisfying when the party finally dished out justice. Meanwhile in P5R, I pin-pointed the masterminds as they were becoming apparent, which made the grand-reveals tiresome, since there was no room for any surprise other than the amusing payoff for the interrogation that follows the prologue. A fun moment near what could have been the game’s climax, only for the game to continue going for 30 more hours. What about the characters? Well? What about them? In my opinion, all of them are hollow by comparison to P4G's cast, and when I kept internalizing over this, I came to the conclusion that, unlike P4G's cast, you barely experience the lives of the cast in P5R. Sure, you social-bond with them, but I don’t feel like I’m learning more than what you infer from their presented tropes. They rarely do their own activities or bond with each other. Actually, one of the big missed-opportunities is the development of their Showtime moves, which is one of the only times you see these characters do anything with one another. By comparison, in P4G’s cast, several sections of the game are devoted to their enjoyment of doing fun shenanigans together outside of dungeon-crawling. It made them feel like real teenagers and not just a group of one-dimensional tag-alongs. Another factor that led me to this conclusion is that the characters In P5R feel like they are shackled to you. Wherever you go, they are there to spew their one or two lines of input, which leads to repetitive banter. When I think about a character like Chie from P4G, I remember the times she ruined nights with her cooking, or when she discovered that the easiest way to defuse Yukiko was to send her into spiraling laughing-fits. When I think about Makoto from P5R, I remember that… She’s smart? I don’t remember her favorite foods, and I only remember that her dream is to become police commissioner because she reminds you about that dream at the end of the game; something I completely forgot about by that point. She was also my romance-option, which …Speaking of, the last detail I will bring up is the romance. In P4G, the chosen partner you go with is not only prone to having moments with you throughout the story, but other characters react to your pairing. It wasn’t overly-done, but it was there, and I would argue more pleasant than what you get out of most RPG romances. In my P5R play-through, your pairing means nothing to the party and dialogue doesn’t change between you and the chosen partner. The only time I recall that your pairing has a tangible bonus to the story-telling are three moments near the end of the game. Your chemistry may as well just be pretend outside of these few moments. This should not be a big deal, but when one of the defining pillars of the Persona games focuses on the relationship between characters, I should think romance would, at the very least, match P4G’s detail. What I ended up liking from P5R were the little things. I liked the music, the setting tone (despite the weak plot), and the interface, which is fantastic. Even just the menu screens have a way of really hyping you up for the boredom you are about to undergo. I’m sorry if I seem harsh on the game, and I respect that a lot of people cherish it, but I just can’t ignore that P5R made me miss P4G more than I thought I would. I gave it a fair shake out of respect and stuck by it until it ended, but now I’d like to move on. Saying goodbye to the cast in P4G was tragic. Saying goodbye to the cast in P5R was a relief.",0.596966385841369629

It's a concerning sign of this game's content now and to come with how long it's taken for me to only partially upgrade any one gear set only to a mix of level 2 and base level 1 out of level 3 max. I got to Frenzy 2 of the first area in a couple hours, and I've spent 3 or 4 times that long to not yet get any of the first area armor and weapon sets up to full level 2 for each upgrade. And I've had to play Frenzy 1 of the first area probably 10 times just to get that far, as you only get certain items off the proper enemy tier, or from random item rewards that you might not even see on any given run. My Rillo helmet is 2 and 3, and legs are max, but my armor is still 1 and 1 because I just haven't gotten enough Rillo hides to upgrade it in about 7 or so hours of actual active game play time. My Yammo set is 1&3, 1&3, 2&3 with no upgrades to any of the weapons yet. Fortunately to beat Frenzy 0 of the second area, max base defense on the Yammo set and the fact I like the Claw spear that I have been able to get to 2&2 got me through Frenzy 0. I haven't crafted all of the decor yet that needs Rillo drops, only 2 and that was 1 Rillo drop each. There's still at least 1 more, and also tier 2 Rillo drops to take into account for armor, weapons, and decor first craft cores to buy other things. At least in something like Rogue Legacy, you start reliably bringing back stuff to upgrade every run, you feel the progress every run. You also have choices of farming the easier areas each run vs. taking on the harder areas first. Each run you can experience the harder content and learn strategies while still getting progress from the easier areas. This game, no, you want to level up with maximum chance to get the lower tier items, you will do the easy area, and only the easy area, that you're already crushing into oblivion again, and again, and again. I know the game is early access, and I didn't play Rogue Legacy until it was done, so hopefully things will improve. If not, I doubt my interest will last, which fortunately it's only $10. The combat is generally fun, and has the ""Klei style"" (if you can even say they have a brand style), polish, and bizarre excellence they usually show in every single genre they try is present in the actual combat mechanics. But the initial pacing looks like a game that will have X hours of unique content that takes 5 to 10 times longer to actually complete. I played a bit more after typing a lot of this up, wanted to look at a few more things. And trying out Frenzy 1 of the second area just felt very sluggish, especially the first boss, which isn't helped by being encouraged to be heavy or at least medium weight. And I feel I was close beating Owlitzer, but I can't just keep trying like Nioh or Dark Souls, gotta go back to town, run to the copter again, load up the stage again, fight through all the areas again. Thinking about playing it 15+ times just like area 1 Frenzy 1 to level up any gear I may want eroded away my desire to keep going through it. I felt maybe if I leveled up the Claw spear, maybe I could get enough damage boost to keep going, but it seems I have to farm at least Frenzy 3 for one of the items to drop, and the pacing is very slow to hopefully get 2 more of that item, and I'm prone to dying a couple sections in so far.",0.5007132887840271

I want to enjoy the game. I don't mind the silly level of writing, sometimes it's kinda refreshing to have something that I can just shut down my brain to. That part is not an issue for me. I don't mind that, for the most part, character stories are separated from each other. I always enjoyed games like SaGa Frontier, Live-a-Live and such. So that's fine for me. I really, really like the combat system. It's among the best turn-based combat systems in the genre, for me, probably only behind Gust newer turn-based games and maybe some of the Falcom games. And yet playing the game feels like a chore. Moving from one place to another means going through areas where you get a random encounter every 4 steps - or every 5 steps if you equip the skill that reduces the rate, barely any difference. This makes exploring the world and getting all those hidden chests and stuff, something that should be fun, become a drag. Worse, this makes the fun combat, that is the strongest point of the game for me, start to get tiresome. Yes, the combat is good - but facing the exact same enemy for the 300th time isn't. And when you do arrive in a town, there's around 15 people for you to interact with up to sixteen different field skills. Getting to a new town is a major ""I'll stop here and continue later, too tired for that now"" moment for me. Now, I'll fully concede that this is heavily due to my own playstyle - I could probably simply ignore the NPCs instead of interacting with all of them. So if you are not a completionist in wanting to see all the dialogues and descriptions and sidequests and such, you may ignore that last bit of complaint. For now, I think I'll set the game aside and wait for a mod that reduces encounter rate, or see if I can find how to make one. Maybe there's a memory address that can be reliably modified with a cheatengine table or something, dunno.",0.817680537700653076

Exploring the world is beautiful , until you don't get stopped every 10 seconds for a random encounter (even with the reduced encounter buff, they are still too many), this makes walking around incredibly frustrating if you are not trying to farm.

I don't feel this review has to be as lengthy as the review for the first game, considering this game is essentially just more of the same. It has the same strengths; it's extremely pretty, the music is fantastic. And it's got the same weaknesses; weak character interplay, strange balancing. What I noticed more in this title than the previous is just how god-awful the caliber of writing is. The stories are essentially very standard, very stale JRPG fare. Characters do monumentally stupid things or make mistakes they shouldn't make in order to arbitrarily create some sort of weak, ineffectual conflict. For example, lifelong successful merchants will suddenly not realize there's a clause in a contract that robs them of all their wealth, and now they have to get it back and right the wrongs! It's all so very eye-rolling. This is a pretty simple review to write because it's a relatively straightforward sequel: If you liked the first Octopath Traveler, go ahead and buy this because you'll probably love it.

Combat system is solid, progression system works....done. Now for the bad. In short: they have neither learned from nor improved upon the issues of the first game. Party Story There is neither. You have 8 solo characters that have absolutely nothing in common and that have virtually no interaction either. You have 8 mini stories that are outright crap. Stories are cut into chapters and intentionally made so you don't play 1 characters story without interruption. There is no connection between either story and the chapter design is...sh*t. Enter area, get popup, confirm you wanna do the chapter, get hit by walls of text, use the characters path action at least once, get hit by more walls of text and occasionally you get to fight a bit...story chapter done. How low can the developers of Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest fall ?... Path Action ..is like 90% of the game. Every single character story chapter revolves around the characters path action. There isn't a single side quest you can finish without using at least 1 path action, several can't even be started without. And even the skills for 2 jobs (inventor and armsmaster) are locked behind path action. This leaves you with the ""choice"": pick a party that has all relevant actions..or constantly switch members...but neither is actually an option. Choosing a party with all actions leaves you with like 1 party setup, constantly switching fails because path actions are not limited to towns where you can change party members and more (example at the end). Adding day and night means you have 2 options for each result for day and night (e.g. 2x steal for day, 2x steal for night)...except it doesn't work. The game does not allow you to beat up children (sadnes...). The warrior's day action knocks out NPC blocking your path...by beating them up...can't use it on children. Can be worse... The priests night action gains information..by beating the NPC up...again can't use it on kids. Only way to get info from kids during the night is ...bribing them with the warrior which wastes money. Even better is the scholar who has a ""steal"" night action...by beating the target up. => not on kids. Only way to get items from kids during night time is the dancer...but her path action depends on her level. There is the next problem: only the characters in your active party get xp. So you can't just switch in the dancer for her path action...nope, you have to lvl her first. Example The promised example: A sidequest requires you to get a new lens for a lighthouse. Every normal game allows you to talk to the NPC and offer to buy it...not this pile of **. You have to use path action...and out of the 4 steal path action only the one from the merchant is allowed to be used. So you run back to town, switch in the merchant, run to the docks, board your ship, sail across the sea to the island, walk up the island to the lighthouse, buy the damn lens and go back to town to switch out the merchant.....truely great design....",0.610902190208435059

My experiences with the game are mixed. Octopath Traveler 2 has great pixel art, the OST is outstanding, and the combat system is one of the strong points of the game. Why is this game a 5/10 then? Well, it comes down to several areas: [*]The 8 playable characters have entirely separate individual stories. There's barely an overarching story that involves crossover between them. They join your party because you just happen to be walking by. [*]Most of the character's stories are poorly written. A few party members have good pay-off, but the amount of time spent on bad or cliché stories made me skip or fast forward through the dialogue. [*] Whether you're in a dungeon or out in the field, every 5-10 seconds you will be thrusted into combat. The frequency of random battles is unacceptable. The skill that lowers the frequency of battles makes the encounter rate more reasonable. [*]The character you choose initially can't be changed out of the party until you fully complete their story. [*]Characters not in the party receive zero experience. This results in you having to grind party members at different times from lower levels. [*]Banter skits between party members only appear during a story chapter, and they have no voiceover. [*]The mini-map only shows the general direction of the next areas, and not any detail of the current area you're in. I did not play Octopath Traveler 1. My expectations of this game were elevated initially by seeing the overwhelmingly positive reaction. In the end, I believe Octopath Traveler 2 could have been a much better game with a reason for these 8 characters to be in a party with one another. The game's story format and writing are ultimately a detriment.",0.610124170780181885

The whole flow would interrupt for an absolutely pointless information dump. I know it's sort of a feature of the JRPG that the writing is a little lackluster, but the obnoxious voice acting on multiple characters makes it unbearable for me.

There is no party interaction whatsoever - All the characters are strangers to each other, despite being in a party. The game is essentially 8 side stories, with no main story. If you're looking for good JRPGs, I recommend playing Chained Echoes instead. Great graphics, though. Edit: And to recruit main characters, you sometimes still need to help complete strangers do dubious things without questioning their motives. Also, with Temenos you play a massive asshole that goes around, beating up innocent townspeople to obtain infos. Ochette captures beasts, makes them fight for her, and then turns them into Jerky once they are of no more use to her. Her main companion animal must be constantly on the edge, always wondering when it's her time to become shashlik. Hikari likes to force innocent grannies into duels. Like wtf, lol. It's kinda funny, but nonsensical. Edit2: It's strange that commenters defend these issues by saying that the final chapter resolves them. It doesn't matter if the final 10% has a unified story and character interaction, when the first 90% don't. It's just weird to have 8 protagonists that do not interact with each other in any meaningfull way. Still playing this game because I already played all the better games, but it's anything but great. Edit3: There is also this weird part where you've got a party of 4 heroes, but in cutscenes there is only ever the current side story's main protagonist present. As if the others did not exist at all. It's especially strange when the protagonist gets in trouble and there is seemingly nobody to aid, even though you just fought a battle with a party of four. Edit4: It seems like the writers gave up completely during Ochette's chapter 3. The storytelling keeps getting more nonsensical.

If the enemies in the game scaled to your party better, it might be more interesting - but 90% of the fights in this game are one-sided beat downs that take you far too much time to execute. You never really feel threatened as the player and thus the system is largely uninteresting. The gameplay loop is extremely repetitive with no difficulty anywhere to be seen. You spend your time ferrying your squad through an exhausting number of random encounters to reach really poorly written story segments that drag on longer than they are welcome. I will confess - I did not make it deep into the jobs system that is available in the game and only hoovered up 6 of the companions - but I just could not see how they were going to ultimately make the combat interesting, and it looks like I was a good 20-30 hours of grind away from being able to evaluate it.

Despite its issues it's still a step above the first game. Has some QoL stuff such as quick travel, while adding in some amount of interactions with party members. The music itself is really good. Likely will find myself listening to the soundtrack on occasion, basically put it into my rotation. Gameplay wise the game is decently standard. Once you find your combos you start destroying things and doing massive damage. The joys of these games is to destroy bosses as hard as possible. It's hilarious deleting 45 level bosses, watching the in fight cutscene happen, then slapping them for however little damage and they just disintegrate. Some characters also feel stronger than others. Agnea feels like she does very little while in comparison Hikari is just tossing around big numbers like it's going out of style. Ochette does too but not on the same level. Other than all that the game is your very typical jrpg flair, not much unique besides the final boss. A lot of it still feels disconnected, namely only having 4 people at once, so typically it only ends up being one on ones or very rarely involving 3 characters. I have yet to see one with 4. On top of the fact that they're also unvoiced so there is a disconnect there on top of it. It feels weird knowing this has been a solved thing having all 8 characters all together, yet the devs decided to make it a issue. Not sure why. Story wise the game struggles. Due to the aforementioned nature of the story being overall disconnected, some things feel random at times. But it's okay, by nature the game is mostly pretty freestyle, but now that I'm talking about story, I technically have 9 stories I need to think/cover. So I'll just... go into spoiler territory now and give a list of best to worst. - Spoiler Territory - 1. Castti, 2. Throne, 3. Partitio, 4. Hikari, 5. Temenos, 6. Ochette, 7. Osvald, 8. Extra/Final, 9. Agnea Favorite Character: Castti Starting Character: Ochette Main things to note: Agnea's story felt like nothing. The ""villain"" kinda just felt like they shoved her in there because they forgot to make one. "" All For You"" is mid. They could have easily talked about how the industry notoriously abuses stars/idols, but opted not to. Although I can't recall if the first game did this, either way. Castti's was the only one that got a emotional response out of me. Osvald standing there like a idiot for two chapters was dumber than rocks. Ch4 was mostly fine, ch5 was some next level ""what the hell are you doing?"" tier shit. Throne hyped me up, killing those assholes felt so good. Partitio is a good man, although I would have preferred a ethical capitalism vs late-stage capitalism approach. Hikari was typical anime stuff, although I did like how his latent ability changed names and color scheme. Temenos was better than expected, the detective stuff was neato. Ochette dropped the ball with its final boss. The start of darkness was technically in the beginning when the (animal not chosen) attacked unprovoked. The rest was clearly manipulative and tried to get some ""oh, the poor thing"" points. The final story, well... I just think the typical ""depressed villain doesn't find their life worthwhile, so clearly life in general is meaningless"" thing has run its course. This seems to be happening more actively. Each time it's a eye roller. I cared nothing for it. I did find it sweet that Partitio being how he is was Ori's reason to keep on living. Odd how she didn't see other characters like Ochette and especially Castti in a positive light like that, but it's nice. - Out of Spoiler Territory - That's about it. Mostly it's a fine game. The grind is a bit excessive, especially if you want to fight the super boss. Although I'll be honest it's not a fun fight so I wouldn't recommend going for it anyway. Despite my gripes maybe you'll end up liking the story beats. Personally I see these types happen time and time again that I'm a little just tired of it all. There ARE better RPGs out there, but this game is pretty. Although I would recommend turning off the blur/bloom in the engine.ini file, seriously you won't regret it. The game can be pretty uneasy on the eyes. In the end this felt more like a expansion of the first, with nerfs here and there. There are definite improvements that can be made, especially to reduce grinding. Also, the banter should be voiced imo. Breathe some life into the characters and their interactions with eachother. Especially when they all have different stories, they are the life of your game. In my case I got it 20% off, so that helped my decision in getting it. If I had to pay 60 for this though? Yeah, nah. I can't recommend the game at this price point. Get the game on a sale if you can. The improvements aren't enough to warrant another $60 price tag imo. Your mileage may vary though.

It's almost like for every good decision made there is one either not carefully thought out or hashed together. I want to mostly speak on the writing aspect of the game as it's the one that I had the most problems with. I think that if the game did not try to lean on this aspect and was just a fun explore-at-your-own-pace with minimal story in the background thing then it would be better off. It is not that though, and it is always wasting your time to give bits and pieces in the form of cut-scenes that drag you out of the world. 1) Story feels only like events happening instead of something that has cause and effect You cannot have an overarching plot that fumbles it's way through sectioned bits of storytelling. The beats themselves are passable, but this world in particular feels so lifeless as (I dare say it) your immersion is throttled when you are taken out of a town to hear another tale from one of the 8 party members you recruited. Seeing a little bubble pop up from one of my members with 'I have something to do here' feels like railroading than something that organically happened from exploration. The individual stories themselves are..fine. They're not terrible but never once did I resonate with the dialogue or felt particularity intrigued. It is not that 'the stories are simple' rather they are unevenly distributed as writing for 8 characters separately means that you cannot possibly have the time to flesh them out appropriately. I was stunned when I did a chapter for another character and it only took me roughly 40 mins to an hour. ""That's it?"" It took me 10 hours to gather them and 1 hour to resolve one of their chapters. 2) The characters are markedly unimpressive as a cohesive whole, and separately they don't have enough devoted presence to really establish them. Now this is my opinion, but I'd rather have a cast of 4 really strong party members with great stories than 8 party members who have middling stories and personalities that are carbon cut-out tropes. Don't get me twisted however, a good trope can go a long way. Tropes exist because they are familiar and can do a lot of foundational work. Example: Tenemos is snarky and I like that. Partitio seems like a good guy. However, the issue reveals itself where I watch these stories unfold and I can pretty much guess the behavior of these individuals because they never grow beyond what is already laid out for them. Yes, they go through trial and tribulation but they will always default to their prologue behavior as the game does not want you to spend more time than it chooses to patch things together eventually. That's the impression I got. The writing suffers due to it's unevenness, which is ultimately a letdown. There is always that sinking feeling of 'it could get better!' Maybe the stories become more in-depth and there's some great payoff but I just don't think I have the patience for it. If the writing were more thoughtful, if the cut-scenes were more engaging, and if the characters stood out I could get through it and feel satisfied. Instead, I feel distracted by any attempt of plot. A real shame too because the music is absolutely wonderful, visuals too. The actual GAME is fun but I do not consider these lopsided intermissions of storytelling to be a game activity as I'm just sitting there in my chair and watching it unfold with sometimes a button prompt or two. I hope that the next iteration of this franchise continues to grow. I think the concept here can absolutely work but it needs more dedication in some places (mayhaps highlighted in this very review!) instead of compromising to deliver a 'finished' product.",0.547705948352813721

(So far, 10hrs in) the story is VERY bland and extremely predictable on top of this the story is hurried up too much to make the characters and side characters feel like they matter. I'm fully aware that Octo = 8 = 8 different stories that overarch, but the reason for the main characters to join up is just lazy and awful, having your character die in D&D and having your 2nd character randomly join the party makes 100 times more sense than all the characters here. I will be playing the game to it's end and change my review in case my opinion changes. But right now it's too predictable, too bland, boring abilities, WAY to easy, the stories are cliché and what's up with ALL the bad guys being in caves and manors?

Let's start with the good -- very talented voice cast and very good music The Bad -- Horrible, shallow story-lines. In some cases, I even skipped through because they almost made my brain bleed (looking at you Agnea!) Very jarring to be forced to switch between different character stories ... however, if you focus your grind and cheese, you can basically roll the game and its bosses by focusing and completing a few chapters of 2 characters. This game is nothing more than a forced grind. It's fun for the first few hours, and then you feel like a chinese farmer going through the motions, listening to the same catchphrases, music, spells over and over -- which becomes really annoying when you have to backtrack as a level 55, but are stopped by level 2 mobs, with no way to auto-resolve or dodge non-xp fights, even with Osvalds ""evasive manuever"" ability -- to dodge fights. For a game that is being touted as ""difficult gameplay"" I have beaten every boss on my first try, without guides, except for 2 -- and even then it only took me a second or third try. Ironically, one of the main bads ... the POWERFUL HARVEY!!! (that's the villains name, for reals) with the dumbest name in recent history, gave me the biggest issue. Bosses are pretty easy, with the ol' Deus Ex Machina nukes, that come out of nowhere, without reason, as you wear their HP down. It's the most cliche play and does not an interesting/challenging fight make. It's fine, you just expect it and hold your breaks/stuns. I've found the game so easy, that I have used less than 5 magical items/potions, besides the basic HP/Mana/Res items. No need. I stumbled upon the Foresaken Graveyard, grinded for an hour, got some good items and my level 40 toons are hitting level 45 bosses at 9999, without a crit, numerous times in a row, with cheesed companions who hit ungodly hard, while my buffers/healers support. Save for the first boss, I don't think I've gone longer than 15 rounds before beating any boss. The pixel art is pretty for a little bit, and then it all starts to look the same. I get it, it's retro. Cool story. With that said, I'm done with 4/8 toons stories. I know this goes to chapter 8, for an ending ... and then of course, you have to complete every sidequest and grindy, un-intresting obstacle they throw at you to finish the ""REAL"" ending. I don't care. I don't care about any of these over-dramatic, shallow characters or story-lines. I don't care about the silly grind. I don't care about any of the empty side-quests. I don't even care to finish the game. So ,,,, $60 not to care to finish the game. At least I have Divinity 3 to look forward to, someday.",0.538372039794921875

It absolutely deserved its status as a popular Game of the Year contender/choice. A few highlights I want to make are: [*] Many of my major gripes with Grand Theft Auto V are actually solved in RDR2. The game's economy is far better-balanced instead of everything revolving around the one-time Heist payouts and the stock market, combat isn't overly reliant on having cover (and thus making combat in the wilderness unfairly challenging), and the heat system is MUCH better as opposed to GTAV that punishes you from doing too good a job escaping the cops by spawning more nearby. [*] R* games are usually well-scripted, but RDR2 is well written and it's almost immediate in how quickly you tell the difference. While previous R* games still had intricate stories, details and loveable characters like RDR2, this game features far better integration of narrative themes and character arcs. Dutch Van Der Linde is probably the single greatest character in Rockstar Games history and RDR2 has a story I think can stand on its own as not just a good, but a fantastic story- If this was a classic cowboy movie, it would've been remembered as one of the greats. [*] I also really like the life simulator aspects to the game, too. I was surprised by how little the body looting/animal skinning animations actually bothered me, especially as both actions are extremely optional (which I did do, by the way, I just never found it too annoying). While it's a bit eeeh, I think the game does a good enough job maintaining its immersive atmosphere that I accept some degree of eeeh for the purposes of realism's sake, and the life sim stuff REALLY makes this game feel like a role-playing game of sorts where you are legitimately rewarded with both a richer experience and gameplay rewards if you actually get invested in being your character- The Honor system helps play into that, too. I also think the Cores system is a pretty genius way to implement a kind of soft ""hunger"" system to the game and add some fun resource management without being even remotely annoying or troublesome. [*] Easter eggs and oddities are 100x more common in RDR2. You can pick a direction, ride in that direction, and find something interesting in the wilderness that always feels fresh, not just an ubiquitous collectable to find. Practically every player will find SOMETHING that leaves a massive impression on them, and you can explore this world for hundreds of hours still finding new things. Re. Performance errors, I did encounter the dreaded NVIDIA stutter, but after tweaking with options and trying the Rockstar-approved fix, I was able to solve it and everything else was smooth for me. The game's never crashed on me in my time playing it, but my PC is on the higher end of the spectrum and I don't speak for everyone. So, why the negative review? I'm not actually saying you shouldn't buy this game, this is a review in protest of the Online mode in general and intended to be a warning if you are purchasing this game with Online being a factor in your purchase. (either for moral reasons or because you're actually interested) I honestly think Red Dead Online is a better experience than GTA Online, as you can walk for more than a minute without getting killed by the dozens upon dozens of ludicrously overpowered vehicles that roam that abomination- This is partially due to RDO's more grounded setting/feel, and because the open-world is better designed and doesn't cluster damn near everyone in one tiny tenth of the map. (though Saint Denis is usually pretty populated if that's what you're looking for) Plus, the playerbase is generally less interested in senseless murder and 9/10 people you meet won't kill you on sight. And, quite critically, instead of most people spending their time in scripted missions, RDO does a better job juggling between missions and openworld gameplay for moneymaking. It ACTUALLY feels like an open-world game gone online. Admittedly, these missions are largely ruined by forced public matchmaking with no option to solo, so the ""mission"" is more you running around killing things being constantly pressured by the level 200 hardcore grinders to move faster, skip every cutscene, ecetera, but hey, the open-world gameplay is okay enough. And, here's the BUT... Take Two are a bunch of greedy assholes who are certainly not even remotely happy with making some of the best-selling games of all time with ludicrously profitable microtransactions. Nope, the in-game economy needs to either get people dedicated and invested in the game (and therefore willing to spend money on it), OR for whales who want to actually have fun without hours upon hours of grinding for basic necessities, the spending of as much $ as possible. Many items cost several times more than they do in the base campaign (especially cosmetics, 100 RD$ is relatively cheap for a single hat, and hanging up a small picture in your moonshine shack can cost quadruple that), money is much harder to make, and most insidiously, the secondary Gold Bar currency that's extremely tough to earn outside of doing Daily Challenges every single day to keep up a Streak is used not only for things like exclusive cosmetic items, but to bypass level gate requirements and the Roles, which are the primary moneymaking methods and to be frank CONTENT the mode has to offer, are gated behind extorbitant amounts of Gold. Each of the four Roles costs 15 Gold Bars (except for Moonshiner, which costs 25 AND requires the Trader Role to be unlocked and levelled, so you need a total of 70 Gold Bars to unlock every Role and actually experience what the full game has to offer), and to put that into perspective, completing a Daily Challenge earns you 0.2 Gold Bars. You do get multiple Daily Challenges a day, the aforementioned Streaks can help, and you can get around 0.08 Gold Bars per open-world Stranger Mission you do, but it's REALLY horrible, blatant content-gating behind huge paywalls designed to psychologically manipulate people, and there's also the ""Outlaw Pass"" (guess what that is) if all that wasn't enough money lining Take Two's pockets. I'm not sure which system between GTAO or RDO is worse, GTAO's inflated currency resulting in unbelievably excessive money burning pits like the Yachts, or RDO's incredibly stingy economy that has created a system where its players are deathly terrified of investing money in anything they won't make regular use out of, but I seriously dislike both and I can't give a positive review in good conscience to a product that employs either system to extract money from players. Look, I'm not against grindy games, I'm not even wholly against microtransactions, and I actually would LIKE the appeal of a world in which every dollar felt precious and like an achievement and where I have to work my way up from a broke cowpoke to an untouchable gunslinger badass- But the presence of a BUY GOLD BARS button immediately obliterates that and is a complete breakdown of player trust. I can no longer assume stupidity when such a massive motivation for malice is present, and I can't go ten minutes in Red Dead Online without being reminded once again that I'm playing a psychologically manipulative scam. Feel free to buy this game for its single-player mode, but I cannot recommend it when it's attached by the hip to Red Dead Online.",0.878949403762817383

Arguably the most ambitious game they have created to date. However, I cannot currently recommend it for multiple reasons.

Regardless of the fact I can typically run it on a mixture of high/ultra settings @70-90FPS (1080Ti / i7 8700k), I still encounter the ERR_GFX_STATE crash, and the proposed workaround does absolutely nothing to remedy it. Another known issue I encounter is a weird smudging effect with objects in the distance, and with hair/beards. After a bit of searching online, I've deduced this could well be an issue with the Anti-aliasing (TAA in particular). It's not as noticable on higher resolutions, but it's still something that should be addressed. While the game is now ""serviceable"", it still runs like shit for a lot of others, even after several patches with R* insisting the game is fixed.

To add insult to injury, a week after it released on Steam, the game is now on sale @ -20% for the standard edition & -25% for the Special and Ultimate editions. Apparently this is how R* treats the Steam user base. If it wasn't for the fact I'm over the 2hr mark, I'd consider getting a refund, and waiting for some optimisation and a more appropriate price tag.

I am not an MMO fan. I definitely recommend trying it. BUT. There are a few PSAs. ***DO NOT BUY- THERE IS A FREE TRIAL** https://store.steampowered.com/app/312060/FINAL_FANTASY_XIV_Online_Free_Trial/?curator_clanid=34459938 ***YOU WILL NOT be eligible for the free 1-60 trial if you buy the game here!*** !!!!!!!! IF YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS YOU MUST BE ON THE SAME DATA CENTER !!!!!!!! There is EASILY 100 HOURS of content you can get out of this game WITHOUT PAYING. You can play ALL content of levels 1-60 with no limit on playtime by signing up for the free trial. Level 1-60 content includes: *Around 3/4 of all combat classes, with the exceptions of: Gunbreaker, Dancer, Red Mage, Samurai, Sage, Reaper *All crafters/gatherers- sewing, smithing, fishing and mining to name a couple *~50 4-man dungeons, all featuring unique gear for all classes, environments, music, and bosses *~40 8-man ""Trial"" boss only fights, emphasizing mechanics, with unique rewards and arenas *6 24-man Alliance raids, where you fight series of bosses from previous titles How square handles accounts and licenses is awful so I will try to explain: -IF YOU BUY ON STEAM, you must download the game via steam, make a Square Enix mogstation account, and register the steam key to the account. You will have ONE FREE MONTH and then you MUST pay a sub to continue playing. -IF YOU BUY FROM SQUARE, you must make a freetrial.finalfantasyxiv account, then download the game. You will use this account to log in from the client. -IF you want to play on ps4/5- you will have to buy another copy and any DLC. Only one subscription. --- Now, with that out of the way, I will review in brief and then go over more details. (Leave comments for input/questions!) PROS: + 90% OF PLAYERS ARE HAPPY TO HELP YOU: Many people talk about the supportive and friendly playerbase, but I can't emphasize this point enough. If you have a question, you can /shout a question in the local chat and somebody nearby will probably help. But because its other people, not everyone has this experience. + CULTURE: People legitimately stand around in hubs and have discussions with strangers, show off fashion, RP, and craft. There are many clans and discords to join and find a community. RP, housing, fashion, photography, ERP are popular and easy to find. You can play this like a solo game if you do not want to talk to anybody- there isn't anything important or useful that is locked behind clans or friends. + RESPECTS YOUR TIME: There is nearly no grinding and no time pressure. If you stop playing, your gear and unlocks are going to be exactly how you left it when you come back. While you wait to get into a dungeon (DPS queues are the longest but during regular hours are around 15 minutes), you can fight, watch cutscenes, do quests, and even play as any other classes. If a cutscene is going to take a long time (10 minutes+) there is nearly always a warning beforehand. If you have to skip, disconnect or forget, you can rewatch every cutscene in the game at any time. There are daily dungeon reward bonuses, but you can get that same currency in abundance with no weekly cap, and is only relevant every 10 levels after 50. The most ""premium"" currency is earned nearly exclusively by these dailies is for nearly best in slot lv 90 gear, but the weekly currency cap is so low you can hit it easily in 2 or 3 days of casual (1-2 hour/day) playing. +THERE IS NO PAY TO WIN. You can buy emotes, clothes, and mount. + PLAY EVERY CLASS WITH ONE CHARACTER- instantly change out of comba + NO FOMO: Every piece of content is there for you to experience it, and the content that has been cut were a handful of old boring quests for the main story. While you might want to rush get to the endgame content, everything is self-paced. There are no useful ""seasonal events"" / ""season passes"". Those events that do exist often happen yearly, go on for around a month, give out cosmetic gear or mounts (which can sometimes be bought for real dollars later) and are ALWAYS accessible from level 5-10 (which takes probably less than an hour to get to). + AMAZING MUSIC: a MASSIVE range of AMAZING music written by one composer, Soken. Just go to youtube and listen for yourself. Search ""ffxiv"" with any following (there are no spoilers in these fights): ""Fiend"" ""Ink Long Dry"" ""Down the Up Staircase"" ""Answers"" ""Footfalls"" ""Beauty's Wicked Wiles"" ""To the Edge""""Dancing Mad"" + DIFFICULTY FOR ALL LEVELS: LOW- you don't have to worry about bringing down the team. Dungeons and bosses are generally a breeze as long as there is one player who isn't new. Even then, if you are still worried, there are MANY new player youtube guides for each dungeon and fight. HIGH- there are more than 40 ""Savage/Unreal"" boss fights that require careful gear selection, stat boosts, precise positioning, movement, and reaction (around 3 seconds at the highest end), mastery of your class abilities and damage output, and close coordination with teammates. There are many ""statics"" with open recruiting that practice multiple hours while in call on the same fight for weeks to work towards a single clear of one of these fights. However I MUST emphasize THESE ARE OPTIONAL, and only done by the top 0.01%. While they give best gear, the stat increase of this is negligible to most players, and no content requires it. + MINIMAL TO NO BOTTING + 100% CUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY AND HOTBARS- any size, anywhere. + Awesome controller support --- Neutral / more subject to opinion * No in-game mic * Main story (MSQ) is REQUIRED for unlocking all locations and dungeons. You do not get XP/items by killing overworld enemies, but by doing dungeons. Your class level is independent of your current MSQ, but important class abilities are locked behind class quests. You cannot ""main"" a crafter or gatherer to progress the story. Everyone has to go through the MSQ before getting to the new content. While level and MSQ skips to level 70 or 80 (not sure which) are available for purchase, they are frowned upon because early level story and skills are fundamental to enjoying 70/80+ content. *MULTIPLATFORM- Play with people of all ages and experience on ps4, ps5, windows, mac, at any time *DATA CENTERS- Although there are data centers in NA, EU, JP, and now Oceania, it is not uncommon to find UK and AU players on NA servers. Ping is never an issue. Load times vary between device and ISP. *PLUGINS- 3rd party plugins and analysis tools are forbidden, and your account can be terminated if you are caught using them. --- CONS: -BAD START- It is to be expected but low level gameplay is boring. You only have about 3-5 very simple combat abilities. 90% of time is spent having to read dialogue, teleport/walk around towns or walk to a spot in the wilderness. You don't get a mount until around msq level 30, so for the first couple of hours you are mostly walking. Teleports cost $ (which is only a problem in the first 20 levels) and can only be done when you have walked there before, so there are even times when you might have to search for a boat or gate to travel to a different city. I actually quit playing at level 30 3 years ago because the story was boring and all the going back and forth for hours on end when I wanted to explore combat. However, I was doing sidequests that do not reward or unlock anything so I was legitimately just wasting time and stalling. -MASSIVE download- When trying to play this game at home, I spent an entire week just trying to download the game. You download the client, and then EVERY PATCH in sequence. For the majority of the users, your download might take 2 or fewer hours with 500MB-1 GB/s fiber optic. At home, I had spotty 9MB/s, so the download time was 8 hours. Any time the connection dropped, the download had to restart at the beginning of that patch.",0.793262302875518799

This company is ridiculously difficult to do business with, though. Here is my sordid tale: I was in the mood for an MMO so I fired up FFXIV thinking I'd do the free trial, fully expecting to quickly cap out and shell out for the subscription. This was basically a free sale for them - I was absolutely their intended sucker for the trial levels. After repeated failures to even install the demo, I discovered that I had once participated in a free weekend/trial event and already had a level 15 character, which completely precluded me from activating the trial to level 35. I did several hours of research and found no way around it, and finally gave up. No free sale for Squeenix. Fast forward a year and myself, my husband, and some friends all have a week off. It was suggested we all dive into FFXIV together. I knew the trial wouldn't work for me, but I figured eh, why not drop the 20 bucks on the base game and subscription for a month. I logged into my old account to confirm it was still there, purchased the started pack on Steam, and tried to activate it. No dice. All sorts of billing errors occurred. Searching for the codes suggested I would need to call support. You know what? I'm really not invested in my decade-old trial character, so I tried to register a new account. -- email is in use. I guess that makes sense. So I plugged in a different email and successfully created a whole new account. Then my husband tried to join me and ran into errors. He tried three different email addresses and got locked out of each one, being told the email was in use but when he tried to log in being told no account is associated with that email. He contacted support and was told that because an account was registered at this IP (my account...) he could not make an account for 24 hours. Seriously? They've never encountered a situation where two people at the same residence want to create an account together? I am absolutely boggled by this. Furthermore, support absolutely refused to help him. The only response was ""Wait 24 hours"", but all of us were playing *tonight*. That was unacceptable when there must be a solution for them to remove a lock on account creation. If they don't have that in place I don't know what to say. The starter pack is non-refundable, and he was completely unable to play, so at that point they had essentially stolen his money (for a minimum of 24 hours). He tried to register using a VPN but that was detected and blocked too. He finally registered from a different location entirely, then came back to log in to install the game. It was the most ridiculous process I've seen. What possible evils are they preventing by being so restrictive about account creation? Oh no, someone might give them money :( The game is fine. We're playing and getting our starter pack's worth out of it. I'm terrified to actually do any more business with this incompetent company, though. --- UPDATE after 100 hours: The game is really good, and lives up to its reputation as one of the better Final Fantasy stories. The MMO portions of it are fine too, and live up to their reputation as one of the better MMOs. This game is worth your money. BUT. Do not buy it through Steam. The entire purpose of purchasing a game like this through Steam is to gain the protection of my locked down Steam account, consolidating my accounts in one area, and lessening mess and clutter. I thought I would be able to use the Steam subscription features like I did with Elder Scrolls Online, which was quite convenient because I don't like handing out my credit card to website. You cannot use the Steam subscription features with this game. You can pay through your Steam wallet, but you still must pay through (and enter all payment details into) the Mog Station website. Paying with the Steam wallet works the same way paying with a credit card does. It does not let you use the subscription feature. Buying this game on Steam only gives you a link to the launcher and a CD key, which you then have to take to their website to create an account with. Steam cannot even keep your game updated, because it only links to the launcher. Worse, once you purchase through Steam and pair it with your account, you are locked to purchasing through Steam. You gain NO BENEFIT for doing this. All it does it lock your options and add a secondary layer of DRM to your gaming experience. This game is worth your money, but they should be forced to provide their own customer service and update their aging systems, not leech off Steam for advertising with no additional benefit to the consumer. --- UPDATE 2022: I have two weeks off for holidays and I finally finished Cyberpunk and wasn’t sure what to waste all my time on, so I thought “Hey maybe I should check out the new FFXIV expansion!” But then, remembering how difficult it was to give this company money, I decided I should secure a subscription before spending money on the expack. The Steam experience of this game continues to impress in all the worst ways. I “installed” the game and, of course, Steam just provides a link to the launcher. So I launch the launcher figuring I can at least get all 80GB of the game installed and such, only to have the launcher tell me I cannot install the game because I do not have a subscription. Awesome. So I wander into the Mog Station and clicked on the pay with Steam option and it prompted me to add money to my Steam wallet. So far so good. I loaded money into the wallet, and I even generously figured why not pay for 6 months, and then I don’t have to deal with this for a while and I will (maybe) feel less pressure to log in and play all the time since I’ve already paid in advance and got a teeny tiny discount. (I know it logically doesn’t make any sense but that’s psychology for you). So I loaded 120 dollars into my steam wallet and headed back to pull the trigger. When I attempted to subscribe I got an error. Fortunately this error happens BEFORE it takes your money or I’d be really pissed, but it also means I’ve loaded a shitload of money into my steam wallet and I can’t actually give it to them now. I tried all sorts of different things, including different browsers, and no dice. I googled the error code and it suggested the problem is that I am Canadian and there’s an issue with the exchange rate. But Steam already handled the exchange rate when I loaded the wallet… ugh. It also wasn’t an error code about insufficient or unrecognized funds or anything like that, it was literally just “There’s a problem. Contact support.” I futzed around for a bit and then finally followed the error code’s advice and opened a support ticket. Or tried to. The link on the error code said “Contact support”, so I clicked on it, but instead of taking me to the contact page it took me to a FAQ. I had to click through a bunch of troubleshooters that had nothing to do with subscriptions before it would believe I actually had a problem that required support to solve, and finally, begrudgingly, took me to a support form. The support form wouldn’t let me submit my question unless I filled out my home address. They did not provide any options for Canada, so I literally couldn’t fill out my address. I picked a random state and hoped it would go through. I also very explicitly stated in my problem description that I am from Canada and the error code might be linked to the exchange rate with Steam. This was on a Friday night, so I had no real expectations of hearing back quickly, and found a different game to play. I heard back from them on Monday morning. Their advice was to run a virus scan and try again. Seriously. WHY is it so difficult to give these people money?? So I guess I won’t be buying Endwalker in the Steam holiday sale…",0.755585730075836182

It seems a while back, Square Enix made the choice to strongly-separate the Steam and Desktop versions, akin to how Desktop and PlayStation versions are separate; except that you cannot have BOTH Steam AND Desktop licenses for whatever arbitrary (I'm assuming ""lazy"", I think they claim ""security"" or some nonsense) reason. So while I would normally give this game an enthusiastic thumbs up, since I'm unable to actually play the Steam version I own without setting up a second Square Enix account (I guess I could dualbox?)... I have to give it a thumbs down and hope that this saves someone else from wasting the... whatever $20 or so that I've wasted without researching it thoroughly. In my defense, this really doesn't seem like the kind of thing that one should be expected to research -- it should just work, and the fact that it doesn't makes me disappointed in the FF14 team... who I'm normally not at all disappointed in. For background, I was hoping to play in my Steam Deck without messing around installing Lutris or XIVLauncher; but I guess that's just the world we live in. EDIT: I did reach out to Square Enix, as one comment suggested they could fix this for me. But the final response I got was: ""...a Steam version of the base game, as well as any expansion cannot be registered on the same Service Account if a Windows version is already registered on said Service Account. The only way to register the Steam code is by creating a second Service Account."" Which means that I COULD set up a second account for my Steam copies -- even using the same login, I think -- but I think I wouldn't be able to play characters from my original account using Steam (and vice versa).",0.7387734055519104

This one however is extremely frustrating. To make a long story short it comes down to balancing issues at the moment. *Having end game armor and getting 1 tapped *Hostiles can block your attacks but you can't block theirs *(More you build more they attack) Builds 1 tent gets 6000 man horde... obviously embellishing but have a base with 500 logs worth of wood vested and roughly get 12-24 rather difficult mobs every 6-12 hours (in game days NOT RL so it's about every what feels like 30 mins but its WAY too often) *Island is massive but every single square inch of this place has mobs. Unlike the first where it felt more balanced and the shock of running across a hunting party was thrilling and scary. This one it becomes absolutely annoying because its shoved down your throat everywhere everytime. *The need for base building in any way shape or form is purely for the sake of doing it. It has no contribution to quality of life what so ever. SURE you can store food/items BUT the amount of mobs/difficulty increase because of those mobs is not balanced. The game is enjoyable early on but as you get more gear you feel weaker and weaker as the horde is blown WAY out of wack against you. idk hopefully they address much of these balancing issues. There are loads of little bugs too but most are manageable just remember to save all the time. I will change this negative review into a positive review when I feel like I have breathing room in the game at day 30. 20 man horde spawns every real life 30 mins to 1 hour is just too often. I hardly have time to gather resources, repair, heal, ACTUALLY WORK ON MY PROJECT before I'm doing it all over again. I play for hours now and hardly get anything done because I'm constantly defending/repairing/healing. Hence the base just not being worth it at all. Defenses ? Yeah right... they will blast through your walls like they don't exist. Half of the mobs just glitch on through. Spikes and traps ? good luck for whatever reason they do like no damage and the aI routing just avoids it.",0.822862207889556885

In terms of graphics I give it 11/10. Combat is a bit clunky, but I'm a Skyrim kid so I actually kind of enjoy it. Adding a companion that is actually useful is a first in a game like this as far as I am aware, and I think it adds a nice pace. That's about where the fun stops for me. My first night, I built the recommended lean-to with my tarp and a stick. Apparently this game runs on a ""more you build the more enemies appear"" system. Knowing that, I shudder to think what some of these players who have like 600-700 log bases, because my one little tent caused 7 difficult cannibals to hunt my ass on day one. The building is also really, and I mean REALLY clunky. I'll give it a pass on some of the structure glitches. I played ark for a long time so those don't bother me at all; however, the fact that the enemies can destroy half my log cabin in 2-3 hits is ridiculous. The fact that damaged support beams will render me unable to fix or replace floors, ceilings, etc. without taking apart my entire build is also stupid. Unlike the first game, there are enemies behind literally every tree on the entire map. So many to the point that there isn't even a horror element anymore, the enemies are just annoying. Adding to that, the fact that you still get a ton of damage when you block an enemy's attack but they don't even move when they block is unbalanced and dumb. And not Soulslike unbalanced, I'm talking ""the only thing that makes the enemies difficult is the fact that they one tap you while you have to mash them like a boiled potato"" unbalanced. I also made the mistake of picking up all the little things I found on the ground on my first save, only to find out there is NO way to quick transfer items to a shelf. I had hundreds of leaves, and I had to transfer them one by one, and sit through the 1-2 second animation for Every. Single. Leaf. And its more than just leaves, there are printer inks, rocks, sticks, berries, etc. all which come in bundles by the dozen that you have to slowly place on the shelf one by one. Biggest complaint by far. As small as it is, it is such a fundamental and frequent part of the game that it is probably going to keep from playing unless the devs add a quick transfer feature. Overall the game is just kinda mid and not worth anywhere near $30 in its current state. I understand it's still in ""Early Access"" but I'm getting really tired of all these game devs and publishers coming out with early access as an excuse to release an unfinished game just to collect on the cash earlier. Finish making the game and maybe I will change this review to a positive one. You hit it off with the first game, do better with this one. Disclaimer: If you enjoy the game this review is not for you. I do not in any way think that everyone should hate this game, or stop enjoying it because of these things, I'm just saying that I dislike this game in its current state because of them.

Looks nice, played ok, but just like a takeaway it left me unfulfilled. Ultimately it's a disappointing survival experience. Methods for survival are limited - because the sole purpose is to follow the story. Water collector? Gone - got to drink from a stream until you get to a 3D printer (yes, a 3D printer) and even then carry two 3d printed flasks? Nope - apparently that breaks a fundamental law of the universe or something. You can build, yes, but you can't really 'craft' anything. Essential items have to be found through the storyline - for instance, only one shovel has ever been brought on to the island apparently and that selfish bugger who had it took it with him to his demise. How about clawing at the dirt with your bare hands? Nothing that requires a shovel is deeper than 6 inches. Nope. You must get the shovel, lest your podiatrist beats the ever loving crap out of you I guess. Keycards. Think Doom, but over 9 square kilometres. 3 keycards which each open a different area. Again, only one of each on the entire island. Now, that's fine but it's just indicative of the reasoning behind a lot of the 'logic' behind SOTF survival - it is just 'busy' work, for the sake of it ('it' being the e-longlongman-longation of the story). There are buckets, for goodness sake, on the beach when you first spawn in. Can't use them at all, not even to store small rocks or berries (let alone water). Want to store those small stones? Can't drop them - build a set of shelves and carefully store them in neat cairns of 30. I mean, what the hell... If you're coming direct from The Forest you'll probably love it. If you've played anything else in between then you're likely to be very disappointed because like the discoveries that require that shovel, it's all very shallow. They (Endnight) could draw out the survival aspect by allowing a full tier of rudimentary equipment, from diy glue, duct tape, water containers, cooking equipment (to actually cook actual combined meals), stone/scrap metal tools, leather etc that could provide many hours of initial gameplay before you get in to the story - setting up camps at tactical locations around the map as you explore, for example. Not only that, it might also provide some replayability because as it stands, within 10-20 hours the story is over and there's nothing left worth doing and no reason to play again - the story will be the same and so will the limitations. (disclaimer, I have not played multiplayer). My opinion: wait for mod support - if it arrives (modding tools and workshop support) then have at it - the location is superb and empty - ripe for filling. If mods can bring proper survival crafting (gear, food and even more prefabs) then this could be a prime blank canvas. As it stands, unless they're going to revamp the story arc I can't really see what else they're hoping to bring to the table, other than a few fixes, dedicated servers, optimisation, a fricking turtle shell water collector and rafts. Goddamit - will no one think of the rafts?! If you want to sling Endnight 30 bucks and it's nothing to you, then by all means do so. If it's going to be a choice between a week of good meals and plain pasta and ketchup then don't. Hell, if it's a choice of another game or this one, then think carefully. If you're still undecided, stick the $30 in a jar, hide it under your bed and find it around September time.",0.782813370227813721

But i dont recommend buying it in early acces and to wait for the game to be done. I will write my review, stretched out in positive and negative points to make the overall view more clear. POSITIVES : - The surroundings and audio is abolutely gorgeous. - The basebuilding is super smooth, fun to do and MUCH easier then forest 1. Also more building options. - Interaction with the cannibals, observing their 'behaviour' is really well done. - The inventory looks really cool and is well made. Easy and smooth to use. NEGATIVES : - There is not really a true ' adventure' feeling as you literally get guided to all the points u need to be by a GPS tracker. In Forest 1 u had to actually go find all the caves yourself and it felt more rewarding. - A LOT of big areas where u find literally 'nothing'. Just feels like a big map with no real purpose. If there isnt a GPS tracker, most u find will be some loot containers. - Documents u find can not be viewed again( exept for books). I´d like a journal for those, like Forest 1. - The story ending feels extremely rushed. ( U put in lots of gaming hours, to just see a short cinematic at the end, thats it). - No boss fights. ( not even one ? Come on.) - A lot of unnessasairy equipment, stuff u will never use. - Too much recourses to find like food/meds/drinks. This doesnt feel like a survival anymore. - The cavesystems that u find are overall kinda boring compaired with Forest 1. - Not enough cavesystems. ( In Forest 1 the underground is almost just as big as above. Not in this sequel). - I was waiting for a "" WOW moment"". A jaw dropping moment. Like when u find that massive sinkhole in Forest 1. There is literally nothing like that here. Was constantly waiting for that feeling like ' OMG WTF' ?? but it never came and i feel dissapointed. - Things got added to the story that have absolutely no place there. Its about an interdimensional shift the whole story,but in the end u get 'demons' from hell that u cast away with a cross"" ??? It just doesnt fit there and it feels really confusing. Its feels like they wanted to almost force a religous component to the story, tho it has nothing to do with that. - At the end, i got really confused. Like i said before, it was really rushed. So much that i had to google if that was the end or not. - The developers blame the rushed ending to the early acces. But in my personal opinion, in early acces u can expect bugs, maybe bad visuals, not enough audio.... stuff like that. But i dont feel it should be an excuse for a bad ending. They said that they will add things to the ending and try to make it more better over time. I hope its true, but i wont be playing this a second time. They gave the game an overall bad feeling at the end and they should have put more effort into the end stage. Not only a first impression makes your game good, but also the feeling wich u end it with. I feel dissapointed and left hungry for so much more. - I hope the review helped to get a perspective on it !

Craft, build, and struggle to survive, alone or with friends, in this terrifying new open-world survival horror simulator.",Endnight Games Ltd,Sons Of The Forest,Newnight ,"It's releases like this that make me wish there was a ""50/50"" option, and I'll preface my review saying that my rating is based on the Early Access, first version of the game—so things may change. I loved The Forest, having spent hours with friends creating a bunch of memorable experiences, and it still holds my interest all these years later. In a vacuum, Sons of the Forest is a decent survival game with an absolutely beautiful environment and a satisfying construction and crafting system. Enemies are detailed with complex and interesting behavior patterns. In comparison to the original game, however, Sons of the Forest is a poor follow-up that left me severely disappointed. There are many positives in the game (which I know other reviews will touch upon), but I'll list some of the many issues that come to mind below: - Unlike the original game (which required you to find and explore points of interest all on your own), Sons of the Forest provides you with a GPS from the very beginning, with several markers to explore. This absolutely kills the sense of adventure that the first game had, and players end up just going to and from one of the ~8 points on the map since there's no reason to look elsewhere. - While the map itself is much bigger than the original, the few points of interest mean that the forest feels extremely sparse and feels like a slog when going from one point to another. - The caves in this game are so much less interesting to explore. Where The Forest had a complex, interconnected network of tunnels that went throughout the island (creating many ""wow, look where we ended up"" moments), Sons of the Forest opted to have much fewer and very linear caves that simply had one defined entrance and exit every time (with one-way mechanics), ensuring you'd never be interested in returning after doing a fine-enough sweep through it the first time. - The caves not related to your marked objectives are little more than caverns for you to pop into for 1 minute, collect cloth, and leave. I genuinely wonder why they were even put in the game without offering much of anything that contributes to the experience. - Building materials are abundant and weapons easily available. Halfway through, you'll have way more than you'll ever need. - Where The Forest had many animals, each with their own kinds of hide for specific items (Spear bag, Rock bag, etc), Sons of the Forest barely has half of those as its predecessor, only has one kind of hide, and only allows you to make hide armor out of it. Wildlife is no danger at all, and hunting animals is not necessary (not even for meat). - Enemy variety is severely lacking. As interesting as the cannibals are in this game, the non-cannibal enemies were more of a threat in the first game should they find you, and made building a shelter essential. The vast vast majority of non-cannibal enemies are only one of two, which aren't too hard to dispatch. The deadlier, more interesting ones were so rare that I only encountered them a couple of instances over the course of the whole game (on normal difficulty, I cannot speak for the other modes). - Because of the above issue, and the ability to set up and break down camps anywhere with the tarp, building a shelter feels completely unnecessary, especially when you know where all of your objectives are ahead of time. - The story and ending were extremely underwhelming. Watching the trailer for this game would have had you think it would be more or less a direct sequel to the first, but left me feeling mislead. This game gives you very little context throughout, with only a handful of scenes contributing to the story (which on its own is fine, but by the end makes you feel like there could have been much more). While the original had a much better exploratory nature, providing you with numerous ominous photos and artifacts, this game provides extremely little in comparison. If you're like me, you'll get to the end, full of supplies expecting a challenge, only to be met by the last cut scene thinking ""is that it?"". The Forest's ending was way better! I could keep going, but I think I highlighted the most important issues I currently have. I know the game is a work in progress, and is why I didn't mention the many bugs I encountered (geometry issues when building structures, meat being reset to raw, etc). I expect these will be fixed in future updates. However, a lot of the problems I have were design decisions that I don't anticipate will be altered. The game itself is a fun enough, fantastic looking survival game (seriously, it's one of the best forests I've seen in a video game), but it just doesn't measure up to the value I got out of The Forest. Since finishing the story, I don't feel compelled at all to keep playing. I wouldn't have bought it full price, Early Access had I known what I know now, and if not for all of the positive review-bombing this game got on release. I don't understand why the developers made some of the decisions they did. With all this in mind, I really can't recommend the game in its current state if you were a fan of the original. See what they do with the next few updates or just wait for a sale.",0.771642625331878662

Less content than the original game, and all the blueprints are copy-pasted from the first game. Don't even need to build a shelter, it's just a waste of time because there is no survival aspect as mobs only actually spawn on like day 15, you'd complete the game by then. Heavily underwhelming combat, exactly the same from the first game. The new mobs contribute absolutely nothing as they all have boring attacks but look different. The core game is the same, similar 'find items in caves' as the first one. If you've played the original, don't buy this, if you've never played The Forest, then yeah it's not bad. 90% of all sounds are used from the previous game, which doesn't seem like a big deal, but when you actually play it, it's highly irritating and also the mobs have no footsteps and so you don't hear them coming until they've actually hit you. All it is, is the original 'The Forest' but with improved graphics and less content. The appealing 'seasonal' cycle in the game isn't dynamic, when you sleep on day 10, you wake up and it's suddenly winter for 5 days, which isn't even difficult because there's about 100 cans of cat food and 100 MREs which respawn in the numerous boring caves and camps that exist in the game. The inventory system added really cool lights! This is to hide the fact that it's actually worse to use as you have to rotate your camera to find the item you want and if you have too many items then it just reduces your FPS dramatically. The inventory system is WORSE, but they did improve the crafting animations when making or combining items. When you've finally got the sled to enjoy some mountain sledging, it's actually comical because you're going faster than the speed of sound so you actually have no clue about what's going on until you've hit a tree. I can't emphasise enough that the appealing '4x map size' makes the game worse, it's 4x the size with 4x less content, so you're walking through the forest with absolutely nothing there, the only part which is populated is the first quarter island you spawn at, the rest is just emptiness. Also Unity in 2023? Come on now, you're taking the mick, it's terribly unoptimised and the general gameplay is just poor. Unsure how it's got 'very positive' reviews, when it's literally the same as the first game, but worse. Edit: Finished the game, the story is comically bad, don't waste your time. People are also complaining how I didn't mention the 'improvements', the crafting animations, the core building mechanics is more more intuitive (but once again, base raiding happens pretty much late game when you've got everything and the ONLY resource is logs). Kelvin is cool, but is so buggy he almost becomes useless, the amount of times I've told him to go and collect sticks to then walk straight into a cannibal like a buffoon or runs off into the sunset collecting that one stick he found 200 metres away. Honestly there's literally to no improvement from the first game and is in most aspects a step back, mainly because it's copy-paste with some more eye candy fauna/flora. kind regards, trot888",0.756953537464141846

Craft, build, and struggle to survive, alone or with friends, in this terrifying new open-world survival horror simulator.",Endnight Games Ltd,Sons Of The Forest,Newnight ,"Another situation where I wish Steam had a middling review option. I do like this game and I do recommend it to fans of The Forest. Just not at its current price point compared to the available content. For years, The Forest has been the game I use as an example of Early Access done right. The latest patch release of Sons Of The Forest inspired me to throw my opinion out there. I was a huge fan of The Forest and have walked many friends through the story and caves. Sons Of The Forest has a lot of improvements over the first while also taking a few steps back in some areas. It feels pointless to list all these issues because just like the first game, its Early Access. They are all subject to change and will most likely be fixed up quite a bit a year from now. As it stands, there is currently no reason at all to build a base aside from testing the games functions and your own creativity. However, my biggest problem is this extremely strange approach to Early Access they've taken this time around as opposed to the first game. The first game released onto Early Access with one cut scene, a handful of items and craftables and grew from there to encompass a feature complete game with a solid story for those who were interested in finding it. The story elements here in the sequel are as deep and interesting as the first game. The issue stems from the fact the story and its elements are fully completable from the outset, bugs and all. In my experience this has put quite a damper on my excitement going forward because I already know exactly what is going to happen for the most part. I'm sure they will add in little twists and turns here and there as the details to the story are further developed but it can't change the two available endings. Both of which are currently nowhere near as peak as the first games available endings in my opinion. The cut scenes as they exist now, aside from the opening cutscene, are extremely jarring. Sound and dialogue seem to be missing and the animations are very stilted and awkward. This is just a symptom of a bigger problem. The problem being that this game should have just released when it was ready. I don't believe there was any reason for this game to launch in EA aside from laziness and it sort of shows in the game and patch releases. If you play and complete the game, it becomes glaringly obvious that the developers are well aware of the game they are making and where it is headed, but for some reason they insist on dragging out its development time. The latest patch which came out just prior to writing this adds a few new items, a couple cave extensions and some new craftables. Having completed the game already, knowing that I do not need these new items or mechanics to complete any gameplay or story elements is a huge disappointment and is not bringing me back to play more. At this point only the full release will bring me back for another playthough and thats sad. The Forest was EA done right. Almost every patch had me coming back to find new items and experiment crafting as the story progressed, patch after patch. A perfect example of how this was done properly in the first game was the patch that added the climbing axe. Before the patch, the player could find walls in caves that were clearly there to be scaled with some sort of tool. These caves had items the player either wanted or needed to complete the story in both the sense of item progression or plot progression. Sons Of The Forest has none of this. The only item you NEED to complete the game is a cosmetic item that currently holds little to no plot value. For fans of The Forest, I recommend you hold off until the game is more feature complete so you don't burn out your curiosity like I did. For the curious and uninitiated I give the same advice. Pickup the original The Forest in the meantime. Sons Of The Forest needs more time baking in the oven before its ready. 6/10",0.750643312931060791

Craft, build, and struggle to survive, alone or with friends, in this terrifying new open-world survival horror simulator.",Endnight Games Ltd,Sons Of The Forest,Newnight ,"TL;DR Game rests very much as a 5.8/10 for me in it's early access state. I honestly have no clue why this game has 81% positive reviews, even if it's in EA. That said, obviously the game is subject to potentially change heavily during it's 6-8+ months of continued development time. Though, if this is what we get after 5 years, I'm not very optimistic. Good Stuff - The world is very pretty even running on medium settings. This is one of the best looking forest environments in any game to date. - The building (while janky in some areas) is very awesome, probably my favorite part of the game (but see additional notes on building below). - The cannibals have some really interesting behaviors. You will see them climb trees, mourn their dead, capture other cannibals, react to having a weapon pointed at them, stalk you, etc. Some of the coolest parts of this game are the interactions with them (especially early on). - Some (not all) of the weapons are very satisfying to use! - Caving is enjoyable about 60% of the time. - Custom difficulty options are largely solid (though a few additions are needed.) - The changing seasons keep things visually interesting. - The AI assistant the game gives you is pretty awesome. Really didn't use him all that much, but very cool nonetheless. I hope this becomes a standard for future games of this genre. That pretty much covers everything I liked about the game unfortunately. Bad Stuff - The world is basically empty. I have absolutely no idea why developers continue to build these large maps that have nothing in them. While yes, there are interesting landmarks (i.e camps, caves, secret/story areas, etc) these are unfortunately few and far between. At 15 hours, I've seen the entirety of what the game offers in this regard and it's pretty lackluster. - The price. Why this game is sitting at $30.00 USD is beyond me. Unless you plan on continually building an ever expanding settlement, there is at best 16 hours of content here (if you go pretty slowly through the majority of the game as I did). This game really should be priced at the $20.00 mark in it's current state as it just doesn't hold up to other equally priced titles in my opinion. There just isn't enough content here to justify the price imho. - The game gives you WAY too many consumables WAY too fast. At first, I thought this was simply due to playing the game in normal mode. However, this appears to also be the case in the hard mode as well (maybe to a slightly lesser extent, but still). Thankfully, this is easily fixable. Mind you, I'm not saying I want to have to eat/drink 24-7, but it got to a point where I was leaving the majority of loot behind as I had so much in my play-through. Towards the end of the game, my character pretty much ran exclusively on energy drinks/bars and didn't sleep for multiple in-game days. This pretty much makes hunting/scavenging largely pointless. I'd very much like the developers to add a way of adjusting this via the custom difficulty settings. - The story was a major let down for me. The whole plot surrounding the artifact/cube was overly confusing. Following the end of my play-through I had to watch a few analysis videos to figure out what that ending even was. Speaking of the ending, this game ends super abruptly, feels rushed. I have no clue why the devs decided to give you perm gold armor right before the ending, but it really made the whole thing a massive cake walk. Additionally, the whole key-card system for accessing different areas kinda falls apart when they put all of the story areas RIGHT next to each other. My friend and I were able to complete the story in about 6 hours starting from zero progress once we got done building our base. The ending really doesn't give a satisfying answer to any of the questions asked (and yes...I read ALL of the emails throughout the game). The vast majority of our time spent in this game was building...which is unfortunate because.... - The building in this game (while very fun) is totally pointless. When my friend I first started, we took our time constructing an awesome fort with spiked walls, a cabin, fish traps, fires, skulls on sticks, and additional fortifications. This is where the first 5-7 hours of playtime went. However, once you begin traversing the world you realize having a base is totally pointless! You can literally just put a tarp in the woods to sleep (with no fortifications of any kind needed) and sleep through the night without any real risk. As far as food goes, as mentioned earlier, the game gives you so many consumables you don't even really need to setup any sort of fish traps or have a base to hunt from. Again, this is pretty fixable, and I'm hoping this will be fixed with continued development time. - The inventory system is absolutely terrible and annoying to use. It looks very cool, but gets extremely annoying not being able to hotkey your items. A weapon/utility wheel to quickly swap weapons is desperately needed in this game. EDIT: This has been fixed in the latest update. Disregard this portion of the review. - The horror is honestly kind of meh. Not sure if it's just me, but the game really wasn't all that scary outside of very few moments (i.e sitting at a fire and seeing a cannibal watching from fire-light). After a while (approximately an hr or so) the game kinda just turns into survival hack and slash. Mind you, this does ramp up towards the end a bit, but for the most part it is really meh in this area for me personally. - Whole host of typical EA issues janky animations (some of the in-game animations are quite good, but others are VERY bad), weird cut scenes that need lots of work, couple of hard crashes, and a really weird bug that wouldn't let me disable motion blur. Again, these can definitely be fixed, but they are worth mentioning. Brief Rant/Conclusion I really have no clue why people are defending this game RELIGIOUSLY in the comments of negative reviews simply because it's an EA title. The entire point of the review system is to judge the state of the game based on how it is RIGHT NOW. Just because the developers give the promise of additional features to come does not exempt the game from criticism. Additionally, if you don't edit your negative review following improvements made to the title, you're a dick. I fully plan on keeping an eye on the continued progress of this game and will 100% change my review as issues are addressed (as I have done with multiple titles in the past). I'm excited to see how this game develops and I really do hope it improves massively in 6-8+ months. EDIT: Latest update added a ton of really cool stuff and made many QoL changes to the game. The game still isn't at a level where I'd recommend it to anyone picking it up for $30.00, but if the updates continue to be this solid I don't foresee that being an issue come actual release.",0.744852364063262939

You can quickly pitch a tent anywhere to sleep through the night and enemies rarely feel like a threat. Loot is so plentiful (and respawns regularly) and so you have all the food, drink and tools you'll need just by revisiting points of interest.

Building for instance is infinitely improved, but what you can actually create, the presets, etc. are lacking. Massive map, but lack of locations, also seems like there is an inherent difference in what was hand crafted and what was just thrown together quickly around the map, the starting area for instance compared to the Unity like hill areas to the west, especially north west. I am just touching briefly on all the surface level issues. Immense potential, but this really needs more work and substance, more things to do, and the story is just kinda there, albeit laughable, the beginning and end are by far some of the most comical scenes I have seen in a horror game that seems to take itself serious.

Craft, build, and struggle to survive, alone or with friends, in this terrifying new open-world survival horror simulator.",Endnight Games Ltd,Sons Of The Forest,Newnight ,"This is more-so a mixed review as there are things I've liked and disliked and things I haven't fully experienced yet. Most of my time has been on default Hard options in a multiplayer server. I will be continuing to play the game and my review is likely to change as updates roll out. Survival Mechanics- There virtually isn't any, somehow they've shipped a survival game with less nature survival features than its predecessor (outside of the addition of what appears to be a lite clothing system for the snow biome I have yet to experience). To me this feels like the most unacceptable part, it's a survival game and after the first couple days you can have a structure and infinite water/food depending on where you intend on basing. Water is just a free resource generally across the map via the water streams, there is no opportunity for collecting & boiling water from the ocean as far as I can tell (I could be wrong). You can make a water collector but it feels like an empty necessity if you're constantly around running streams. Food is the standard kill something cook it and its incredibly simplistic. Even eating raw meat and/or human meat feels as though there is no consequences. Additionally, once you explore a couple caves or a POI the amount of food (and water) resources you're carrying on-hand can survive you for MANY days completely negating the need to trap fish/small animals. As I mentioned before, there doesn't appear to be any negative effect for eating human meat either so on Hard since you're going to get a raid every day or so you can just chop off limbs, put them on a drying rack and infinite food source the cannibals. Your stamina degradation is incredibly easily managed by continuously drinking water or eating via the sources mentioned above. Having an empty sleep bar also doesn't visibly or noticeably impact my character (I could be completely missing something when it comes to this as I don't let it stay empty for long or often). The what I believe to be strength leveling up mechanic also generally just feels shallow. Exploration / Story- You can find GPS trackers to mark POIs but the game already gives you a bunch of POIs for free so you almost instantly feel like you're already being told to go to specific places rather than explore for yourself. Perhaps this is the intention and there are many more hidden places, but it just makes what I felt like was a key part of the initial playthrough of The Forest unexciting. The environment is quite well done and in many of the areas you feel almost nomad like traveling through a dense forest and want to stop and enjoy the scenery, until you hear that screech behind you and remember you're always being watched. I haven't fully explored the map or every POI and my experience with the story is limited so I won't go any further into details. Construction / Animations- This is easily the most impressive part of the game, I was locked in for quite a few hours just experiencing the animations for various things. Manipulating logs, sticks and the various other construction items feels quite immersive. Free building is incredibly good and while building on slopes can get a little wonky it's not a deal breaker. My friends and I kept joking it really did feel like a ""pioneer / lumberjack simulator"", especially early on. Some of the animations appear to have performance issues and while not entirely immersion breaking are slightly annoying. I will explain this more below. General Issues / Bugs- The AI pathing can get pretty atrocious. The mud covered cannibals that crawl around on all fours have multiple times now been locked in a path where they run in circles around a small tree that would only yield sticks. Virginia also has numerous times run into my home (while running away from my presence) and then gotten stuck running into a corner to then flail around the house looking for the exit. Kelvin himself is quite useful provided his task area is clear of a structure, he has numerous times now walked into the side of my house or another structure and just infinitely walks there into you remove the blocking item(s) (which in some cases can get quite inconvenient). Additionally getting him to drop logs can put him into a ""spin cycle"" where it reaches too many logs in one spot as he groups them and they'll roll away. He'll then continue to grab the same logs over and over again and drop them 2 feet away. Water physics with logs is laughable (actually, it caused comedic effect the first couple times my group saw it). I assume this is why we're unable to build boat houses like The Forest. They just bounce incredibly high and appear to be on ice skates when pushed. Optimization is an interesting topic, the games minimum is a 1060 or recommended 1080. I'm on a 2080 with high/med settings and can rarely pull through 60fps (out in nature). A buddy of mine is on a 1060 and was generally playing on sub 25fps for alot of the time (even on all settings as low as they can go). Logs in water also seem to cause FPS to nose dive though this could've just been coincidental. This is yet another game where Hard = bullet sponge but mob 2 shots you (if unarmored). I personally dislike bullet sponging especially since a brute - not sure if they have a specific name, incredibly large guys with skull mace - takes ~14 arrows to the head but can get lucky once and stunlock and kill you. Weather doesn't appear to be entirely synchronized when playing multiplayer. There was a few times where one of my buddies (we were at one point 4 players) would mention they were in what felt like a hurricane, while some of us had light rain with clouds or in some cases just a sun shower. This appears to be an issue across the board with all weather forms. The intro is awkwardly quiet, no screaming and light on voicelines. It just feels like a pantomime of a helicopter crash. I can't complain about this too hard since the previous game was also like this, was just hoping they'd perhaps try and flex some lite voice acting muscles for the sake of immersion and overall impressiveness. TLDR- Overall SUPER impressed with the construction and animation systems available for use, the immersion these can provide is quite enjoyable. Incredibly underwhelmed by the natural survival mechanics, somehow it has less impact on the gameplay than the previous game. More general issues and performance problems than expected for a project that has been in development for many years with a base game to take ideas from. I haven't fully experienced the game so some of my criticisms may extend from not knowing about a feature or lack of experience in a particular area of the game. I understand the game is Early Access and can be fixed or adjust so hopefully I can keep the review updated to reflect my opinion accordingly.",0.735065340995788574

TLDR: A solid core, but extremely lacking in depth with one of, if not the worst storytelling I have ever experienced in a game. Credit where credit is due: - The core of the game is great. - The building is very well done. - Kelvin and Virginia are well implemented NPCs. - Multiplayer works well. - The graphics are beautiful and the vegetation is very dense, it's really good looking. - Seasons in the game is awesome! But it doesn't really change anything other than looks. These are the negative points I would like to point out, and these are all hopefully gonna be better by full release, and maybe somewhat excused due to the game being early access (Despite the EA tag being slapped on only 2 weeks before release): - The world is so empty, there are barely any point of interests, and the point of interests you find are all the same with the same useless loot. - Loot is respawning way too quickly, there are no materials that are rare, noting worth scavenging for. Most of the time your inventory will be full with everything at all times. - Traversal is boring, you just run from point A to point B, there are no threats as you can easily outrun every single enemy. - Base building is totally pointless. We spent a lot of time building a base only for us to leave it and never return until we finished the story. - Most of the cooler items you get only a couple of hours before the ending, some items you get literally 30 minutes before. - The survival aspect of the game is basically nonexistent as it's way too easy to find food, water and shelter. - One of the worst told stories I have ever experienced. The story starts of with a decent cutscene, but already here with some very questionable choices. During the exploration you will find some notes, clues and hints. This kind of story telling intrigued me and my friends, and we were all very excited to see where they were taking this, discussing the different notes, coming up with theories and trying to make sense of it. Then after some more exploring a totally unexpected cutscene pops up, there is no build up to it, things just seem to happen out of nowhere, no context, nothing makes sense at all. Who? And what? And why? In this cutscene you get the ONLY dialogue in the game which is amazingly three words long! After this we were all a bit baffled, but still intrigued. We carried on exploring this massive empty island. Found some more notes, clues, a giant totally empty mountain with no value to the game what so ever, some more caves, some bigger cave. Then all out of sudden again, a new cutscene. Again no real build up, just another cutscene out of nowhere. These were my exact thoughts during this cutscene: ""What the fuck? Where the fuck did you come from? Who the fuck are you? Where the fuck? Who the fuck are you? Where the fuck did you come from then? And Where the fuck did YOU come from??? What the fuck is this? What the fuck is going on? What the fuck? Who the fuck are you again? What the fuck is going on with you? What the fuck was that? What the fuck are you? What the fuck? Where the fuck am I now? How the fuck did I get here? How the fuck did you get here? What the fuck? No fucking way? Are you fucking serious? What the fuck?"" And that's it. The story is wrapped up in one short cutscene that makes absolutely no sense at all. We feel we just randomly stumbled upon the ending by accident. And it was so random, with no context, and so horribly told we were just sitting in silence on discord trying to understand what just happened. Now I get this game is early access, but this was supposed to be full release until like only 2 WEEKS before the launch. When you plan to go full release like this, and then suddenly switch to early access because ""We feel it is now at a stage where it needs player feedback and involvement to help push this even further."" We didn't at all expect that also meant the story being this extremely lacking. It makes no sense, you don't really get players to give feedback to the actual story, and if Endnight for some reason really wanted that, there's barely any story to give feedback to. The story is by far my biggest complaint about the game, and not something that should've been a problem when the game supposedly was close to being ready for full release, and being in development this long. In this current state I wish they were honest with us and said that the story is nowhere near done yet, and maybe wouldn't even include it in the game at all until it's actually finished. Maybe this is the story Endnight intended but it's just horribly executed, I hope not.",0.735022366046905518

It's very limited, and IMO, pretty unbalanced. Normal mode is a little too easy with a friend. You can build a base fairly easily, and you won't really get attacked until you're on day 25. By the time you're on day 25, you will likely be 90% complete with the main story — if not 100%. Hard mode, however, is exceptionally hard — even with 3 friends. You are attacked every single day from day 3 onward. It is incredibly difficult to build a base, and you will die in 2 hits to most enemies. Building in this game is also limited. You can create a mega base for you and your friends, but you won't have really anything to fill it with. By around day 15, my friend and I didn't really have anything else to build — and up to that point, we spent most of our time exploring. There are probably 4 traps in this game, 1 bed, 3 light sources, and 2 or 3 storage items. You could fill your base with cosmetics but... why? The story, specifically the ending, felt rushed and out of place. So much happens at once. It's also bizarre to find other living humans on the island and not be able to speak with them — they're basically mute. It's unfortunate, because when you're at 90% story completion, it feels like you're just getting started. Ammo is not hard to come by, especially because every loot-able area is refreshed every time you save and quit the game. At the end of the game, I had around 60 shotgun ammo (because I didn't use it), and you need probably 20 shotgun ammo to beat the final boss . From an achievement hunting perspective, I don't recommend this game. 2 achievements are very difficult: survive 50 days (because there is not NEARLY enough content to occupy you that long), and eat 1 of every consumable. It's also annoying that every achievement is hidden, so you can't track your progress. Overall, maybe wait a year or two to play this game. There are updates every 2 weeks, however they are minimal. Last update added a new trap and the ability to place radios (but not turn them on). Why waste time on features like that?",0.733746647834777832

This game feels empty. Kilometres of Forest, and no activities to fill it apart from a handful of empty caves that get your hopes up, and some pointless graves you can dig up for the same loot you can find in the barren caves and underground bunkers with next to no danger. But you can build cool tree bases! Unlike the first game, finding documents and pages don't give any feel or importance to the story. In the first game, if you found a document, there would be music to signify the importance, and it would get everyone excited because it genuinely meant a lot and left you to piece together the puzzle. In SOTF, if you find a brochure or document, it genuinely doesn't feel like anything. There is no feeling of building up to a grand story climax. We spent 2 hours last night exploring in hopes to get somewhere, where we explored 2 locations and we walked for 90% of it. The underground systems we explored were underwhelming, lacking any significance apart from the endgame door we randomly found, which again had no lead up to it. Caves are bland and are just dumped full of the same loot over and over again. after a couple of hours of playing, you literally have everything you need to finish the game resource wise. I haven't played a game in a while where dying has no consequence.

Cons: [*]Poor optimisation (Game runs way worse than TF1) [*]Hasn't got all the features of previous game (The Forest 1)???? [*]Missing buildings from TF1 [*]No keyboard shortcuts to weapons, and tools despite larger inventory??? [*]Larger map, same amount of points as TF1 just longer distances between them (no faster form of transport added) [*]Zipline is very limited range [*]Logs, arms and a number of items glitch with the ground/water [*]No logs sled [*]No mini tutorial at the beginning of gameplay [*]No rafts or sea features? [*]Tables/bench creates infinite logs [*]Dropping rotten meat somehow creates raw meat [*]Calvin glitches with water [*]Animations although they look good can be tedious [*]Cant always open cases and suitcases, glitches randomly. [*]Key card is required in too many caves. [*]AI hasn't displayed any superiority to the previous game yet (other than some mutants asking for mercy) [*]Sounds are earrape (Wind, water and some mutants sounds) [*]Some sounds glitch across the map in multiplayer despite players being varying distances from the source. Conclusion: I have somewhat enjoyed the experience, however in the current state of the game I personally would stick with TF1 for now. Being an avid Forest fan since Early access TF1, I was super hyped for SOTF2 after it was originally announced to be released in 2021. After multiple delays and much waiting (which I was mostly fine with), the game's release has been underwhelming imo. I hope that future updates will fix and improve the game.",0.72993004322052002

Will you conquer your Daemons… or command them?","CREATIVE ASSEMBLY, Feral Interactive",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"SEGA, Feral Interactive","As a preface, I like the core game...but... SO WHAT DID CREATIVE ASSEMBLY DO (this time)? -They have increased the amount of cut content in their games, for which they profusely apologized and then did not make up for. Make no mistake, they fully intend to try this again as proven by years of experience Total War: Three Kingdowms and Total War: Rome 2. -People here often forget the dual nature of the main current sticking point. They have decreased the content amount for DLCs AND raised their prices simultaneously. They are claiming rising prices. No specifics, just vague pointing towards 'economy, inflation or something I dunno'. -They have issued a veiled threat to players essentially alluding to the discontinuation of the game's development if WE do not meet THEIR sales quota as if we are their employees that have to take it from them. They also managed to slip in a dangling carrot in front of the more easily manipulable players, citing all the wonderful content they have planned. If only we would gobble up their products without question. Here is the direct quote from them: ""this is the business reality of supporting WARHAMMER III and ensuring we’re able to offer the years of extra content that are currently planned."" SO CAN WE BACK UP THEIR CLAIMS OF INCREASING PRICES? No, not really. CA basically employs a lot of dirty tricks meant to 'maximize profits'. The issue with this incredibly tired, disproven, short-sighted thinking is that it simply doesn't work. And it never has. But to expand upon my point, here are some circumstances to consider: -CA has numerous critiques on Glassdoor about the low salary compared to other players in the industry. -They put a third party anti-tamper solution into their game called Denuvo. This DRM technology has a proven track record of slowing games down by increasing the millisecond time for frame generation as well as decreasing the FPS of games. Sometimes even by 30+ percent. A game like TW 3, which already has a pretty steep system requriement, this is an uncalled for. Also, CA could have taken the money and give it to developers instead of Denuvo. Clicking the End Turn button should not be dreaded. -CA, a studio founded in 1987, employing 882 people (as per Wikipedia) and being bought by Sega in 2005, received a 5 million GBP grant from the UK government that is meant for startup companies. -Their parent company Sega also keeps receiving the VGTR, the Video Games Tax Relief (20 million GBP per year), that they have then used to wipe out the corporation tax bill of CA entirely since 2014 -Also, jsut to see what companies we are talking about, here are their revenues: Sega revenue (2022): 3.14 billion USD Creative Assembly revenue (2021): 62 million USD -CA sold over 22 million copies in the Total War series by 2018 (according to Sega themselves after TWWH 1 and 2), I invite you to extrapolate from partial information where they may stand now. -Wholesale workstation and hardware prices have gone down after the post-pandemic chip shortage is over. -(1st. EDIT as requested by Dance Commander) CA actually tried to put the Red Shell advertisement program into their launcher. While the original public optics all stated that Red Shell is simply an advertisement tool, it later turned out to be the textbook definition of a spyware software. Here is an excerpt from the 2018 Polygon.com expose: Begin quote - ""...the spyware sells itself as a means for video game makers to “uncover where their players come from through reliable attribution.” It “matches” whether players with Red Shell installed on their games visited a market’s campaign, whether Facebook and Twitter, YouTube, a web page or others. To do this, Red Shell has to follow what users are doing outside of the game. But the company said it does not collect any player’s personal information, and only collects information about their browsers and devices “for purposes of attribution.” "" - end quote. On a personal note, I would like to point out that Red Shell: -never actually disclosed what data/datapoints they are collecting -when requested for this disclosure, they did not do it (in direct violation of GDPR) -Red Shell never asks you for your consent to run and you cannot opt out -Red Shell runs even when the game doesn't -Several ad blockers doesn't even let you go to their webpage without first being warned of it's contents CA, after the public outrage, decided to remove it from their launcher. But they did try it, don't forget that. (end of 1st. EDIT) -(2nd. EDIT by me) After reading comments I would like to address some of them here. I won't just fling the ""shill"" tag around as it is reductive and doesn't advance the conversation. ""dude...get a life, these games cost a lot"": Formulating a critical opinion about something someone cares about is considered a bad thing just because it costs a lot of money to make? That is not a healthy mindset. By this logic I should just worship the makers of Star Citizen becuase they managed to sink a country's GDP into their half-baked shambling horror? Also, 2006 called, they want their insults back. ""What a great review that says basically nothing about the game it is purportedly a review of"": A game review doesn't only have to be about the end product only. Sometimes, some events may require a peek at the workshop where it is made in or just warn other potential buyers about the full scope of a situation around a game. Making sure others are more informed before making a purchase is what this community is supposed to be about. I won't apologize for that. ""Denuvo does not effect SSD's"": Indeed, you are correct. I did not do proper due diligence and check the date on several analyses I have based my statement on. Denuvo has since transformed their modus operandi and altered their process from excessive I/O operations, to certain 'custom event-based triggers'. Deleted that section, thank you for noticing. (end of 2nd. EDIT) IN CONCLUSION: Dear Creative Assembly and the two gentlemen who wrote that explanation/apology on the Total War blog. Game development is a service industry in the end of the day. If you bring a good product, people will buy it without questioning it. Furthermore, they will keep buying it for the foreseeable future as there is no stronger marketing tool in the walrd than word-of-mouth. That is of course unless the quality drops. Your studio will not be the first to experience what it is like to reach the point where people will just not care about your product enough. Furthermore, even if you start shipping good content again at reasonable prices, the stink of your decisions will taint that as well. Please do not fall into this downward spiral, it is getting very boring and I feel like I am Jeff Goldblum from Jurassic Park counting on his fingers: -company makes good product -company expands upon good product -non-creatives start dictating how to make product more profitable -non-creatives start bringing out charts and the Book of Drity Tricks -product suffers -more non-creatives are brought in to remedy a creativity-driven problem -parent company has enough -parent company demands more money -non-creatives bust out the Codex of Dirty Tricks -product dies and no one at the helm knows why I leave it to everyone's discretion where CA stands in this process. P.S. (on a more cynical note): CA, pull yourself together, cut out the people making these decisions, pay your valuable employees from the freed up money and return to formula to flourish again. Also, please remove Denuvo, it is just a burden. Give that money to your developers instead.",0.974734604358673096

Lord packs for Warhammer I - £6.99 Lord packs for Warhammer II - £7.99 Lord packs for Warhammer III - £19.99 Race packs for Warhammer I and II - £14.99 Race Packs for Warhammer III - £19.99 Creative Assembly released a statement yesterday (17th August) to the effect of ""we're raising our DLC prices because of inflation and if you don't buy it we will cut support even for already planned DLC"". What's the rate of inflation again? How many millions did CA turnover in the last year alone? I've bought every single DLC for all three games up to now, as many on discount as possible as well as all three base games on discount, but started to get sceptical with the Champions of Chaos release especially after the state that game three released in, it was literally unplayable for me and many others at the time. How did it pass QA at that point? Anyway after some deliberating I decided that Champions of Chaos was fair value. Four legendary lords and a bunch of new Chaos units, I like Warriors of Chaos alot so I thought it was one of the better DLCs. Chaos Dwarves was right on the edge of the boundary of pricing for me, but I enjoyed it and got a fair amount of hours from it. I decided this upcoming DLC is just too far, £19.99 retail for a lord pack is crazy. Add to this the fact that we don't get quality of life updates such as bug fixes unless they're released along side a paid DLC is just sad. It has been three months (25th May) since we last had a major patch. After the release of that patch Nakai could no longer recruit Kroxigors, modders in the community fixed that almost immediately, but CA decided fixing a bug as significant as this, especially for a paid DLC character was not worth the time, until the next upcoming patch about three months later down the line. CA are wasting the potential for this game/series for the sake of trying to increase short term profits, I don't know if they can ride this out for the next two weeks until Shadows of Change releases as they're obviously under immense pressure. With their current stance I think they should be very worried not just about Shadows of Change, but also Pharaoh and Hyenas, although alot can happen in the coming weeks or months. Whilst I'm here and this is minor compared to the other problems, they never added back in the Chaos Undivided soundtrack that was in both game one and two. Of course community modders did though. On YouTube ""Chaos Undivided - Dynamic (Total War: Warhammer Soundtrack)"" if you don't know what song I'm referring to. Imagine your favourite faction without their soundtrack. A detail some people might not care about, but I think it shows CAs lack of attention to some of the aspects that made this series so good. Something that I absolutely hate about this game are the sieges. Towers on the walls that only shoot outside of the settlement? Fine, it makes sense. Towers lining the inside of settlements with 360 degree angle of fire, unlimited ammunition and if they are destroyed then they can be rebuilt. It is probably the one aspect of the game itself that I hate. For now I will leave this review as it is, hopefully something gives, the community for this game would be much happier if the pricing model for DLC was more sensible and didn't feel like we were being kicked in the balls. Regular updates with quality of life improvements and bug fixes not only alongside paid DLC would be very much appreciated, but I don't expect CA to do this. People can do whatever they want with their own money, but for now I want to suggest people hold off giving more money to Creative Assembly just to see if their attitude towards their consumer base changes to a more positive tone. If you want to add a comment to this review then feel free. Update 1st September - I appreciate the comments and everyone who took the time to read my and others reviews. After two weeks since leaving my initial review there still has been no communication from CA about the backlash from the community, apart from their default marketing campaign. They obviously went all in, as I write this the new DLC has already dropped out of the top 10 after being there very briefly and is now sitting around 16th. For anyone who doesn't know, the top 10 is based off of revenue generated, not amount of units sold. It was always going to get fairly high due to the excessively high price, but to see it already starting to fall is no surprise as not so many people are buying it. I would imagine they now wont sell many more units of this DLC. As for the new patch with the improved AI, well, I started a campaign as Khazrak and it is a steam roll. In battles the AI will have most of their 20 stack prioritise warhounds that will kite them around the entire map. The AI has been pretty bad for a long time now, but this is the worst and most easily manipulated I have ever seen it. They have made this game way too easy, I shouldn't be happy to be surrounded by enemies knowing that I can easily farm them all and will not lose a battle, let alone the campaign. CA's behaviour has convinced me to not only not buy this DLC, but also to not buy Pharaoh. Maybe the next DLC will be regular price, but for now this review stays indefinitely negative. My suggestions are fix bugs regularly, atleast once a month, every two weeks could be ideal. Balance passes, take care of the details like units being in the wrong rosters, soundtracks missing (WoC, Beastmen, Norsca) etc. Finally adjust your DLC model. Silence and the Fury, Shadow and the Blade, Twisted and the Twilight, Warden and the Paunch, that is 4 WH2 DLCs off the top of my head that came with 2 lords and 1 FLC lord. Now in WH3 we still get 3 lords but you took the FLC one and put it into the paid DLC, that doesn't warrant a 150% price increase. If you read all of this then you must be a masochist :) Update 14th December - It's been about three months since I last updated this review and so many people in that time have upvoted my review so I wanted to say again thanks for taking the time to read my long winded rant. Alot has happened around TW in the last three months, Hyenas was cancelled, Pharaoh had an awful launch and CA/Sega have obviously felt the consequences. As of the statement that CA posted today, they are dropping the retail price for Pharaoh, refunding current owners part of the price they paid and now the upcoming DLC for Pharaoh will be free. I do approve of them doing this, we all knew Pharaoh was a Saga title, it's retail price always should've been £25-35. I can't help but still be cynical though, this seems like an off-ramp for CA/Sega regarding Pharaoh. I think they want to see if the playerbase increases significantly with the new changes before committing too much. Now about Warhammer. Shadows of Change is going to get a 'major' update next year, by the wording in CA's statement it seems the £19.99 retail price for lord packs is sticking. I think we all have to wait and see if this 'major' update will justify that price. In SoC's current state I didn't even purchase it at £13 when it was on sale at a third-party seller recently. They are really going to have to add alot and improve the quality to justify their pricing. They're really playing a dangerous game in my opinion, but value is what matters. The next thing is, will I consider buying SoC before Thrones of Decay has released? I want to see the quality of the game's development increase and I want it to be consistently high quality. SoC could be revised and become the best DLC, but what if ToD at £19.99+ is another mess like SoC? But what's more important at the moment is the current state of the game. The AI is in a new awful state, the game is too easy. The hotfixes are appreciated but please CA, the AI needs more attention before more DLCs come.",0.966917634010314941

What was once a thriving studio and series has become a collection of broken promises, aggressive sales tactics, and outright threats on the community. While currently in the process of trying to walk all this back the damage has been done. DLC prices have increased while content has decreased. When concerns of this were raised the community was quite literally told to buy it or support would be dropped. When it was pointed out that support doesn't really exist due to the continuation of major bugs, broken AI, and gameplay balancing issues the response was to ban people. When it was pointed out that making a Hero Shooter with Hyenas was a terrible idea and the community wants Rome 3, Empire 2, or something along those lines again the community is told to shut up and get in line. Hyenas has been canceled to the tune of millions in losses and jobs cut. Somehow the problem in all this is the community. When Pharaohs got announced it was met with a criticism and push bask as a reskin of Total War Troy and pushing a Sagas title (smaller budget, scale, and price) as a full scale Total War release wasn't at all what the community wanted. Bare in mind during all this CA dropped support for Three Kingdoms because despite selling well and getting good response it wasn't big enough for SEGA/CA so they killed the project. Apparently a team of just 20 people work on Total Warhammer content now and CA's studio size has been reduced by 40% with hostilities continuing towards the community though CA is trying to walk it back with a non-apology once they got enough push back for banning mod creators on Steam which locked them out of updating their mods or even uploading new ones. Guess CA realized it wasn't the best idea ot remove those actually helping their game. I'm 100% in support of boycotting CA products until this sort of stuff is addressed and the community given the respect it deserves. I've been playing Total War games since the original Shogun hit store shelves back in 2000. There was a time when I held out hope we'd see Shogun 3 but these days I question if studio management and SEGA will allow the studio to continue long enough to release another game let alone something the community is actually interested in playing. Been over 10 years since Rome II released and since then it's been calls for Rome III, Shogun 3, Medieval III, and Empire 2 yet beyond the Total Warhammer releases they've largely missed the mark for bringing something new the community wants. Three Kingdoms had its success but CA and SEGA weren't happy with fan spending so despite being from 2019 the project is dead, buried, and forgotten about. Oh and CA is quick to blame Steam for their harsh treatment of the community. As someone who has moderated discussion boards on here before for games that's a load of crap. But CA is used to shoveling crap to fans so it is on brand. RIP Creative Assembly.",0.959897935390472412

I've played over 3000 hours of its predecessor and was beyond excited for this game to come out. The main problems: 1) Cost (DLC) - Chaos Dwarfs was the most expensive DLC to date, but the upcoming Shadows of Change is a slap in the face to everyone who supported and loved these games. It asks for $25 USD for a few units and three legendary lords. Prior examples in the previous games offered the same exact thing for $10, including one of the legendary lords being free for everyone. Even then, the free lord would still be high quality more often than not. Free ones have included Imrik and Rakarth for the High Elves and Dark Elves, respectively, which became many people's favorite way to play the entire faction. 2) Updates have slowed to a crawl - the game is still littered with significant bugs nearly a year and a half after its release. Communication has been uncharacteristically absent compared to the norms of the previous games. At times, gamebreaking bugs (like Nakai's inability to recruit Kroxigors, the units he specializes in) have been present for three months or longer. This particular bug was fixed for free by a modder in about 5 minutes of work. Which leads us to... 3) The game's future is uncertain and troubling. A previous game in the Total War series, Three Kingdoms, was met with a huge positive response upon release, but the DLCs and updates seemed disconnected and disappointing for many players. Whenever new content came out, gamebreaking bugs would follow, including ones that would never be fixed. When the purchases began to slow down, the entire project was unceremoniously cancelled. Many people fear that this game might inherit the fate of Three Kingdoms. The official response to this price hike has been troubling at best. Many people have invested hundreds or thousands of hours of this series, and wanted to see it through. DLCs were bought consistently and regularly because there was trust and goodwill towards the developer, and while they may not have been perfect, each would often lead to countless hours of enjoyment and unique opportunities and ways to play the game. I and many others just want a return to form. We want to be excited for new content, not anxious. Many of us are more than willing to pay for content that shines with love and care, such as what has already been accomplished in Warhammer II. We want to feel secure in the game's future without worrying if or when the skeleton crew will be recalled. We want to see that the game is cared for and that bugs, especially significant and simple ones, are addressed. We want more open and transparent communication and to see that feedback is being respected. We are upset because we put so much of ourselves into this game and want it to be as great as it can be, living up to the potential that has already been created and witnessed. If Warhammer II was any indication, when the developers are allowed the time and resources to make something great, the community by and large won't think twice about getting DLC that meets a respectable quality for the price. We don't want the future and functionality of the game to be tied to exponential price hikes and radio silence. We want something close to what we already had and what has already been made time and time again. Many have been invested in this game series for over 7 years. Many have been waiting with excitement for the conclusion to the trilogy of phenomenal games. The people who have been hurt the most by this abrupt and inexplicable shift are the ones who have been there for years and have happily and willingly supported the game and all of its content. The ask is only to get something close to what we already had - to what had already been developed, sold, and delivered to us many times before. For better or worse, the treatment of this game will affect the future of the developer, publisher, and playerbase. Make it count.",0.935440540313720703

Anti-player bias was reduced and a lot of big issues such as replenishment was improved for some factions. Whoever is now managing the project seem to be more receptive/involved with the community. I'll keep this as negative still for now but its FINALLY improving the way people asked. Edit#2: Game has fixed most of its launch issues now. A few lay around waiting to ambush you at annoying moments but overall, it's a far better game now. I'm leaving the review up as I personally am very exhausted of total war games coming out with horrific balance and would like this to serve as a reminder. If this game came out in the state it is now in, it would be a big thumbs up. Ooof where to start? The fact that it wasn't ready? The fact that they doubled down on things people hated in the other games? The freakishly slow updates to get some of the most basic issues fixed? The fact a warhammer game needs almost an entire year to get blood added?... a warhammer game, where you can play as the blood god. The fact the main campaign is an absolute miserable experience? There's just.. so much more. I'll start with the positives. The main positive I could give is that factions have much more engaging mechanics to them than earlier games. Even if their rosters are miserably small... no we're trying to say something nice here. Ogres feel actually finished as a roster, with interesting mechanics and a wide variety of units. The bad.. well it's difficult to explain how extremely bad some of these things are with a character limit so short. I could write multiple pages about the design flaws in the main campaign. Flaws ranging from complex issues that are difficult to deal with to amateur design choices that you'd imagine get thrown out the first time they slip from anyone's lips let alone added to a 60$ AAA title. The campaign is effectively a race, which gets triggered every 20-30 turns. Unfortunately, this absolutely kills the pacing of the base Total War gameplay. Everything comes to a halt, as you enter Chaos realms to get a soul first. Only to realiize that you are the only one playing this game. The AI is not playing the same game as you at all. They do not have the same challenges, they do not get the same debuffs, they do not have to complete the same puzzles, they do not need buildings to recruit units, they do not need to actually do anything you do. They just automatically breeze through while you suffer the most miserable experiences of endless debuffs and being attacked by other enemies while your main army is in some pocket dimension. The game actively punishes you for playing the game as intended. Expanding your settlements and empire means the AI will disproportionately focus you. Allowing their own home to be burned down with no reaction, while sending 3 armies to your doorstep. Maybe get allies? They could be useful if there wasn't an in game design that makes any AI who you alliance with, suddenly become the most passive and weak faction. Yes, if you alliance with an AI, they actually get their AI debuffed to not do anything by themselves. The AI is just so obviously AI due to its comical level of player targeting bias. Shamelessly doing anything it can to stop you while doing nothing else the entire game. An issue so bad, even the developers have had to admit it needs fixing. Just keep in mind, this was not added as a bug, this was the INTENDED DESIGN. The game is such a mess, everything has been put on hold. Months dedicated to fix the horrific design choices that were baked deep into the game. Also, 7 months needed to fix replenishment for 2 factions? What is going on over there? How does it take 7 months to fix things that modders fixed within hours of mods coming out? Give it a year or a little more, then it might be in a launchable state. Sadly it could have been good, but CA decided to ignore feedback and stick with whatever they wanted to do. Lets hope that changes fast.",0.923327147960662842

Explore a strange fantasy world, uncover the mysteries of the past, automate your workshops, and go on adventures with your odd &amp; adorable Sparks!",Massive Miniteam,Oddsparks: An Automation Adventure,HandyGames,"To quickly frame the context of this review, the demo for Oddsparks had about 3-4 hours of content in it. I enjoyed it so much that I played it for nearly 12 hours, creating sprawling factories and even making a creative project of a maze from hell that was featured on a community creations post. To say that I loved the demo and was looking forward to it would be a massive understatement. Unfortunately, in the ~2-3 months since that time, the game's progression systems and inventory management controls were HEAVILY revamped, and the linear tutorial (& progression that went with it) yeeted into oblivion. Before, the gameplay felt fluid. Sure, sometimes I couldn't always make a spark do what I wanted, but I always felt like any problems I had weren't with the game itself, but with me not optimizing well enough. And I was okay with that. Now, I feel like I'm constantly fighting against the controls whenever I'm trying to do basic inventory controls. I played a bit on controller and that felt much better, but the kb+m controls just felt to me like they weren't designed by humans, or at least not ones that had played any other video games before. I can't really explain it except to say that I genuinely did feel like I was fighting against the game any time I needed to interact with my inventory -- which in a game about production lines, automation, and crafting, is the vast majority of the game. I thought it was just me adjusting to change, but after almost 3 hours of the game, no, it still just feels bad. Additionally, progression was made.... non-linear. That doesn't sound bad at first, but you can get quests for items you haven't unlocked yet. At the point of writing this, just short of 3 hours in, I have a quest that requires stone and treebark. Stone is unlocked from the start of the game, so you might think this is a beginning-tier quest, right? After all, that's easy to get! But no, tree bark is much deeper into the tech tree. To unlock it, I need to unlock swords (which are about 3 techs deep into their own tree, not even including the unlocks to get there to begin with) because I need swords to unlock the center town tech tree which is separate, and in order to do that, I need to hunt through my 8 different quests, at least 6 of which require things I haven't unlocked yet! It's an absolute informational NIGHTMARE, and just results in feeling frustrated stabbing blindly in the dark and praying that maybe, JUST MAYBE, this next quest will unlock *something* useful to finally make progress again. That's how it's been for me for the last hour, and at this point, it's sucked all fun out of the game. If you had asked me 24 hours ago about Oddsparks, I would have said it was a candidate for Indie GOTY 2024 for me, but now? I can't honestly recommend that a single one of my friends play it. I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Now I can see why the demo was removed: the game of the demo is a very different one that gives people higher expectations of a more fun game than the actual launched product. I wish I could recommend Oddsparks. Even more than that, I wish I could *enjoy* Oddsparks. I had a blast with the demo. But unfortunately, the developers cooked just a bit too long and in the wrong direction and now it's just a game that Could Have Been Great to me. Maybe someday in a few years I'll give it a shot again and see if they've made improvements with the mess at the start of the game, but until then... No, I cannot recommend Oddsparks, one of the very few games I give this rating to because normally, I prefer to say nothing rather than anything negative, but in this case, I've recommended it to too many people and feel obligated to make sure this is up publicly in case I missed anyone with my ""jk, actually, don't buy it."" messages.",0.550654172897338867
